### PART I: THE LANGUAGE MIRROR 

[_Side Note:_] Culture is understood here as all human traits that are not the result of instinct—in other words, as a synonym for nurture as opposed to nature.

Scientists sometimes even speak of “chimpanzee culture,” when
- certain groups of chimps use sticks and stones in a way that differs from that of neighboring groups and when
- this knowledge can be shown to have been transmitted through imitation rather than through the genes.

[_Side Note:_] In Tagalog,

- _kita_ means “just the two of us, me and you,”
- _tayo_ ...means “me and you and someone else,” and
- _kami_ ...means “me and someone else, but not you.”

The dominant view among linguists today—advanced by Noam Chomsky—is that most of the grammar of "language" (that is to say, of all human languages) is innate. This **“nativist” school of thought** contends that the rules of universal grammar are coded in our DNA: humans are born with brains preequipped with a specific tool kit of complex grammatical structures.

According to the **dissenting "culturalist" minority view** , there is scant evidence to show that any specific rules of grammar are prewired in the brain and there is no need to invoke genes in order to account for grammatical structures, because these can be explained more simply and more plausibly as the product of cultural evolution and as a response to the exigencies of efficient communication.

---

For decades, linguists of all persuasions, both nativists and culturalists, have been trotting out the same party line: all languages are equally complex.

If we define a “primitive language” as something that resembles the rudimentary “_me sleep here_” type of English — a language with only a few hundred words and without the grammatical means of expressing any finer nuances — then it is a simple empirical fact that **no natural language is primitive.**

But does all this necessarily mean that linguists are right in asserting that all languages are equally complex?

No one has ever measured the overall complexity of even one single language, not to mention all of them. 

It’s not simply that no one has bothered to do it — it’s inherently impossible even if one tried. 

**There is no way to devise an objective and non-arbitrary measure for comparing the overall complexity of any two given languages.** 

When Joe claims that “_primitive people speak primitive languages_,” his making a simple and eminently meaningful statement, which just happens to be factually incorrect. 

But the article of faith that linguists swear by is even worse than wrong—it is meaningless.

While the pursuit of the overall complexity of language is a wild-goose chase, there is no need to give up on the notion of complexity altogether. **[We should] instead aim for the complexity of particular areas of language.**

---

There is one area of language whose complexity is generally acknowledged to depend on culture—this is the **size of the vocabulary.** 

The obvious dividing line here is between languages of illiterate societies and those with a written tradition.
* languages of small illiterate societies: the average size of their lexicons is between three thousand and five thousand words. 
* small-size bilingual dictionaries of major European languages typically contain at least fifty thousand entries. 
    * Larger ones would contain seventy to eighty thousand. 
    * Decent-size monolingual dictionaries of English contain about a hundred thousand entries.
    * The passive vocabulary of an average English-speaking university student is about forty thousand words.

The reason for the great difference between languages with and without a written tradition is fairly obvious. In illiterate societies... there is no such thing as “passive vocabulary”.

(_A word that is not actively used by one generation will not be heard by the next generation and will then be lost forever._)

[_Side Note:_] Sorbian, a Slavic language spoken in a little enclave in eastern Germany, distinguishes between _hród_, “a castle,” _hródaj_, “two castles,” and _hródy_, “[three or more] castles.”

1992, the linguist Revere Perkin*... 
* assigned societies in his sample to five broad categories of complexity, based on a combination of criteria that have been established by anthropologists, including population size, social stratification, type of subsistence economy, and specialization in crafts.
* Perkins chose a list of semantic features like... the indication of plurality on nouns, tense on verbs, and other such bits of information that identify the participants, the time, and the place of events. 
* He then checked how many of these features are expressed within the word, rather than through independent words, in each language. 
* His analysis showed that there was a significant correlation between the level of complexity of a society and the number of distinctions that are expressed inside the word.
* Not the case that sophisticated societies tend to have sophisticated word structures. Quite the opposite: there is an **inverse correlation between the complexity of society and of word structure.**

Unlike Perkins’s study... recent surveys do not assign societies to a few broad categories of cultural complexity, but 
* instead opt to use just one measure, which is both more easily determined and more conducive to statistical analysis: the number of speakers of each language.
* These surveys strongly support Perkins’s conclusions and show that 
    * languages of large societies are more likely to have simpler word structure, whereas 
    * languages of smaller societies are more likely to have many semantic distinctions coded within the word.

The nineteenth-century German linguist August Schleicher memorably compared the Gothic verb _habaidedeima_ (first-person plural past subjunctive of “have”) with its cousin in modern English, _had_, and likened the modern form to a statue that has been rolling around on a riverbed and whose limbs have been worn away, so that hardly anything remains but a polished stone cylinder.
* The information that had previously been conveyed through endings is now mostly expressed with independent words (such as the prepositions “of,” “to,” “by,” “with”). 
* For some reason, then, the balance tipped toward destruction of complex morphology: old endings eroded, while relatively new fusions materialized.

All the plausible answers suggested so far go back to one basic factor: the difference between communication among intimates and among strangers.
1. Communication among intimates more often allows compact ways of expression than communication among strangers.
    * The more common ground you share with your hearer, the more often you will be able merely to “point” with your words at the participants and at the place and time of events. 
    * And the more frequently such pointing expressions are used, the more likely they are to fuse and turn into morphological elements. 
    * So in societies of intimates, it is likely that more “pointing” information will end up being marked within a word.
2. Another factor... is the degree of exposure to different languages or even to different varieties of the same language. 
    * In a small society of intimates everyone speaks the language in a very similar way, but in a large society we are exposed to a plethora of different e.g. Englishes.
    * Contact with different varieties is known to encourage simplification in word structure, because adult language learners find endings, prefixes, and other alterations within the word particularly difficult to cope with. 
    * So situations that involve widespread adult learning usually result in considerable simplification in the structure of words.
3. One factor that may slow down the creation of new morphology is that ultimate hallmark of a complex society — literacy. 
    * In fluent speech, there are no real spaces between words, so when two words frequently appear together they can easily fuse into one. 
    * In the written language, however, the word takes on a visible independent existence, reinforcing speakers’ perception of the border between words.
    * In short, writing may be a counterforce that retards the emergence of more complex word structures.

Languages **vary considerably in the size of their sound inventories**. 
* Rotokas from Papua New Guinea has only six distinct consonants (p, t, k, b, d, g), 
* Hawaiian has eight, but 
* the !Xóõ language from Botswana has forty-seven non-click consonants and seventy-eight different clicks that appear at the beginning of words. 
* many Australian languages have just three [vowels] (u, a, i), 
* Rotokas and Hawaiian have five each [vowels] (a, e, i, o, u), whereas 
* English has around twelve or thirteen vowels (depending on variety) and eight diphthongs.
* The overall number of sounds in Rotokas is thus only eleven (six consonants and five vowels), whereas in !Xóõ it amounts to more than 140.

In 2007, the linguists Jennifer Hay and Laurie Bauer published the results of a statistical analysis of the sound inventories of over two hundred languages. 

They discovered that there is a **significant correlation between the number of speakers and the size of the sound inventory: the smaller the society, the fewer distinct vowels and consonants the language tends to have.**

No one has yet come up with any compelling explanation for why this should be so. 
* One factor that could be relevant, perhaps, is contact with other languages or dialects. 
* As opposed to word structure, which tends to be simplified as a result of contact, a language’s sound inventory not uncommonly increases due to contact with other languages.

---

**Subordination** is a syntactic process: the ability to subsume a whole clause within another. 
* With subordination, we can produce expressions of increasing complexity that nevertheless remain coherent and comprehensible.
* Although all known languages use some subordination, languages vary greatly in the range of subordinate clauses they have at their disposal and in the extent to which they rely on them.

_Example:_ The narrative style of ancient languages such as Hittite, Akkadian, or biblical Hebrew often seems soporifically repetitive. 
* The reason is that the mechanisms of subordination were less developed in these languages, so 
* the coherence of their narrative relied to a much greater extent on a simple type of “and . . . and . . .” concatenation, in which the clauses merely followed the temporal order of events.

_Reasons:_ [Subordination is] better equipped to convey [some] information than alternative constructions, so it is plausible that [subordination is] more likely to emerge under the communicative pressures of a more complex society.
* The language of legal proceedings, with its zealous insistence on accurate, explicit, and context-independent statements, is an extreme example of the type of elaborate communicative patterns that are more likely to arise in a complex society. 
* As I mentioned earlier, in a large society of strangers there will be many more occasions where elaborate information has to be conveyed without reliance on shared background and knowledge. 


### PART II: THE LANGUAGE LENS

[Edward] Sapir branded [the claim that our mother tongue determines the way we think and perceive the world] the principle of **“linguistic relativity.”** 

In 1931 he advanced the following example for how one specific linguistic difference should affect speakers’ thoughts: 
* When we observe a stone moving through space toward the earth we involuntarily divide this event into two separate concepts: a stone and the action of falling, and we declare that “the stone falls.” 
* We assume that this is the only way to describe such an event. But the inevitability of the division into “stone” and “fall” is just an illusion, because 
* [in] the Nootka language, which is spoken on Vancouver Island, ...there is no verb... that corresponds to our general verb “fall” and that can describe the action independently of a specific falling object. 
* Instead, a special verb, “to stone,” is used to refer to the motion of a stone in particular. 
* To describe the event of a stone falling, this verb is combined with the element “down.” 
* So the state of affairs that we break up into “stone” and “fall” is described in Nootka as something like “[it] stones down.”

Does the fusion of verb and noun in Nootka necessarily imply that Nootka speakers do not have separate images of the action and the object in their minds? 
* We can test this if we apply Sapir’s argument to a slightly more familiar language. Take the English phrase “it rains.” 
* This construction is actually quite similar to the Nootka “it stones down,” because the action (falling) and the object (water drops) are combined into one verbal concept. But not all languages do it in this way.

The excitement about the (largely factual) strangeness of expression in American Indian languages was somehow taken as sufficient to deduce the (largely fictional) differences in their speakers’ perceptions and thoughts. 

Onto the stage now steps Sapir’s most creative student, Benjamin Lee Whorf.

The general structure of Whorf’s arguments was to mention an outlandish grammatical feature and then, with a fateful “hence,” “so,” or “therefore,” to conclude that this feature must result in a very different way of thinking.

There is one toxic fallacy that runs like quicksilver through the so-called Sapir-Whorf hypothesis
* the assumption that the language we happen to speak is a prison-house that limits the concepts we are able to understand.
* “_the limits of my language mean the limits of my world_” ...the distinctions made in a grammar are the same as the distinctions the speakers are able to conceive.

Anthropologist Franz Boas wrote that, in addition to determining the relationship between the words in a sentence, “_grammar performs another important function. It determines those aspects of each experience that **must** be expressed._”

[This] does not seem to have been fully appreciated until two decades later, when the Russian-American linguist Roman Jakobson encapsulated Boas’s insight into a pithy maxim: “_Languages differ essentially in what they **must** convey and not in what they **may** convey._” 

The crucial differences between languages, in other words, are not in what each language allows its speakers to express — for in theory any language could express anything — but in what information each language obliges it speakers to express.
* If I say in English, “I spent yesterday evening with a neighbor,” you may well wonder whether my companion was male or female, but I have the right to tell you politely that it’s none of your business. 
* But if we are speaking French or German or Russian, I don’t have the privilege to equivocate, because I am obliged by the language to choose between _voisin_ or _voisine_, _Nachbar_ or _Nachbarin_, _sosed_ or _sosedka_. 
* So French, German, and Russian would compel me to inform you about the sex of my companion whether or not I felt it was your business. 
* This does not mean, of course, that English speakers are oblivious to the differences between evenings spent with male or female neighbors. 
* Nor does it mean that English speakers cannot express the distinction should they want to. 
* It only means that English speakers are not obliged to specify the sex each time the neighbor is mentioned, while speakers of some languages are.

**Egocentric coordinates**
* Two axes depend on our own body: a left-right axis and a front-back axis orthogonal to it. 
* This coordinate system moves around with us wherever we turn. 
* The axes always shift together with our field of vision.

**Fixed geographic directions**
* based on the compass directions North, South, East, and West. 
* These directions do not change with your movements: what is to your north remains exactly to your north no matter how often you twist and turn.

Each system of coordinates has advantages and disadvantages, and in practice we use both in our daily lives, depending on their appropriateness to the context. 
* Cardinal directions when giving instructions for hiking in the open countryside, or more generally for talking about large-scale orientation.
* When giving driving or walking directions in town, it is far more usual to use the egocentric coordinates.
* The egocentric coordinates are even more dominant when we describe small-scale spaces, especially inside buildings.
* On the whole, we revert to the geographic coordinates only when we really need to do so.

**Guugu Yimithirr**, as spoken by the older generation, does not have words for “left” or “right” as directions at all. 
* It does not even use terms such as “in front of” or “behind” to describe the position of objects. 
    * Whenever we would use the egocentric system, the Guugu Yimithirr use the four cardinal directions: _gungga_ (North), _jiba_ (South), _guwa_ (West), and _naga_ (East). 
    * (In practice, their directions are slightly skewed from the compass North, by about 17 degrees.)
* There are words for “left hand” and “right hand” in Guugu Yimithirr. 
    * But they are used only to refer to the inherent properties of each hand (for instance, to say “I can lift this with my right hand but not with my left hand”). 
    * Whenever the position of a hand in any particular moment is to be indicated, an expression such as “hand on the western side” is used.

Think of the two options on the displays of satellite navigation systems. 
* Many of these gadgets let you choose between a “north up” and a “driving direction up” display. 
* In the “driving direction up” mode, you always see yourself moving directly upwards on the screen, but the streets around you keep rotating as you turn. 
* In the “north up” mode, the streets always stay in the same position, but you see the arrow representing you turning in different directions, so that if you are driving south, the arrow will be moving downwards. 
* Our linguistic world is primarily in the “driving direction up” mode, but in Guugu Yimithirr one speaks exclusively in the “north up” mode.

Languages that rely primarily on geographic coordinates turn out to be scattered around the world, from Polynesia to Mexico, from Bali and Nepal to Namibia and Madagascar.

(Mayan language) Tzeltal speakers live on a side of a mountain range that rises roughly toward the south and slopes down toward the north.
   * The directions in Tzeltal are “downhill,” “uphill,” and “across,” which can mean either way on the axis perpendicular to uphill-downhill. 
   * When a specific direction on the across axis is required, Tzeltal speakers combine “across” with a place-name and say “across in the direction of X.”

In the language of the Marquesas Islands of French Polynesia, the main axis is defined by the opposition "sea-inland." A Marquesan would thus say that a plate on the table is “inland of the glass” or that you have a crumb “on your seaward cheek.”

Different cultures certainly make people speak about space in radically different ways. But does this necessarily mean that the speakers also think about space differently? 
* Instead of searching in vain for how the lack of egocentric coordinates might constrain the Guugu Yimithirr’s intellectual horizons, we should turn to the Boas-Jakobson principle: 
* look for the difference in what languages oblige their speakers to convey rather than in what they allow them to convey. 

In this particular case, the relevant question is what habits of mind might develop in speakers of Guugu Yimithirr because of the necessity to specify geographic directions whenever spatial information is to be communicated.
* In order to speak Guugu Yimithirr, you need to know where the cardinal directions are at each and every moment of your waking life.
* Speakers of Guugu Yimithirr [must also] be able to recall anything they have ever seen with the crisscross of the cardinal directions as part of the picture.
* It follows, therefore, that in order to be able to speak such a language, you need to have a compass in your mind, one that operates all the time, day and night, without lunch breaks or weekends.
    * The most obvious candidate, namely the position of the sun, is not the only factor they rely on.
    * Similar stories are told about Tzeltal speakers. Levinson relates how one speaker was blindfolded and spun around over twenty times in a darkened house. Still blindfolded and dizzy, he pointed without problem at the direction of “true downhill.”

The argument advanced here is that a language like Guugu Yimithirr indirectly brings about the sense of orientation and geographic memory, because the convention of communicating only in geographic coordinates compels the speakers to be aware of directions all the time, forcing them to pay constant attention to the relevant environmental clues and to develop an accurate memory of their own changing orientation. 
* John Haviland estimates that as many as one word in ten (!) in a normal Guugu Yimithirr conversation is north, south, west, or east, often accompanied by very precise hand gestures. 
* Put another way, everyday communication in Guugu Yimithirr provides the most intense drilling in geographic orientation from the earliest imaginable age.

In _The Stuff of Thought_, Pinker argues that people develop their spatial thinking for reasons unrelated to language, and that languages merely reflect the fact that their speakers think in a certain coordinate system anyway. 
* He points out that it is small rural societies that rely primarily on geographic coordinates, whereas all large urban societies rely predominantly on egocentric coordinates.
* His environmental determinism is unconvincing: there is nothing in the physical environment of the Guugu Yimithirr that precludes their using both geographic coordinates (for large-scale space) and egocentric coordinates (for small-scale).
    * Even in Australia itself, there are aboriginal languages, such as Jaminjung in the Northern Territory, that do not rely only on geographic coordinates.
    * Tzeltal, as we have seen, uses geographic coordinates almost exclusively, but Yukatek, another Mayan language of a rural community from Mexico, predominantly employs egocentric coordinates.
    * So [these languages'] exclusive use of geographic coordinates was not directly imposed by the physical environment or by the hunter-gatherer way of life. It is a cultural convention.
* Another critical error in Pinker’s environmental determinism [is] glossing over the fact that the environment does not interact directly with a toddler or small child — it does so only through the mediation of upbringing.
    * As it happens, we know that the geographic coordinate system is learned at a very early age. Studies of Tzeltal-speaking children show that they start using the geographic vocabulary by age two, that by age four they use geographic coordinates correctly to describe the arrangement of objects, and that they master the system by age seven.
    * There is no evidence of formal tuition in geographic coordinates at an early age.
    * So the only imaginable mechanism that could provide such intense drilling in orientation at such a young age is the spoken language — the need to know the directions in order to be able to communicate about the simplest aspects of everyday life.
    * This goes to show that the system of coordinates you speak and think in is determined for you not directly by the environment but rather by the way you were brought up — or, in other words, through the mediation of culture.

* The African language Supyire from Mali has five genders: humans, big things, small things, collectives, and liquids. 
* Bantu languages such as Swahili have up to ten genders, and 
* the Australian language Ngan’gityemerri is said to have fifteen different genders, which include, among others, masculine human, feminine human, canines, non-canine animals, vegetables, drinks, and two different genders for spears (depending on size and material).

The idea of grouping together objects with similar vital properties seems eminently reasonable in itself, so it would be natural to assume that whatever criteria a language has chosen for making gender distinctions, it will abide by its own rules.
* In Tamil, there are three genders—masculine, feminine, and neuter—and you can pretty much tell which gender any noun belongs to given its obvious properties. 
    * Nouns denoting men (and male gods) are masculine; 
    * those denoting women and goddesses are feminine; 
    * everything else—objects, animals (and infants)—is neuter. 
* Another straightforward case was Sumerian;
    * based not on sex but on the distinction between human and non-human, and nouns were assigned consistently to the appropriate gender. 
    * The only point of indecision was with the noun “slave,” which was sometimes deemed human and sometimes assigned to the non-human gender.
* Finally, there are those languages, such as Turkish, Finnish, Estonian, Hungarian, Indonesian, and Vietnamese, that are 
    * entirely consistent about gender simply because they have no grammatical gender at all. 
    * In such languages, even pronouns referring to human beings do not bear gender distinctions, so there aren’t separate pronouns for “he” and “she.”

The great majority of languages have wayward genders. Most European languages belong in this degenerate group.
* Even in the most erratic gender systems, there is usually a core group of nouns that are assigned grammatical gender in a consistent way. 
* In particular, male human beings almost always have masculine gender. 
* Women, on the other hand, are much more often denied the privilege of belonging to the feminine gender and are relegated to the neuter gender instead.
    * Back in the days when English still had a real gender system, it assigned the word “woman” not to the feminine gender, not even to the neuter, but, like Greek, to the masculine gender. 
    * “Woman” comes from the Old English _wf-man_, literally “woman-human being.” 
    * Since in Old English the gender of a compound noun like _wf-man_ was determined by the gender of the last element, here the masculine man, the correct pronoun to use when referring to a woman was “he.”

The few clues we do have make the ubiquitous irrationality of mature gender systems appear particularly peculiar, because all the signs suggest that in their early days genders were perfectly logical. 
* There are a few languages, especially in Africa, in which the feminine gender marker looks rather like a shortened version of the noun “woman” itself, and the inanimate gender marker resembles the noun “thing.”
* Likewise, the vegetable gender marker in some Australian languages looks rather similar to the noun... “vegetable."

But with time the gender markers may start being extended to nouns beyond their original remit, and through a series of such extensions a gender system can quickly be brought out of kilter. 
* In Gurr-goni, for example, the vegetable gender came to include the noun “airplane” through a perfectly natural sequence of little steps: the original “vegetable” gender marker must first have been extended to plants more generally, and hence to all kinds of wooden objects. 
* Since canoes are made of wood, another natural step would have included them in the vegetable gender as well. 
* Since canoes happened to be the main means of transport for the speakers of Gurr-goni, the vegetable gender was then widened to include means of transportation more generally. 
* And so, when the borrowed word erriplen entered the language, it was quite naturally assigned to the vegetable gender. 
* Each step in this chain was natural and made perfect sense in its own local context. But the end result seems entirely arbitrary.

As the history of English can attest, when a language manages to lose not just one gender but two, the result can be a radical overhaul that eliminates the erratic system altogether. 
* Until the eleventh century, English had a full-blown three-gender system just like German.
* The gender system had critically depended on the doomed system of case endings. 
* Originally, English had a complex case system similar to that of Latin, where nouns and adjectives appeared with different endings depending on their role in the sentence. 
* Nouns of different genders had different sets of such case endings, but the system of endings rapidly disintegrated in the century after the Norman Conquest, and 
* Once the endings had disappeared, the new generation of speakers hardly had any clues left to tell them which gender each noun was supposed to belong to. 
* These new speakers, who grew up into a language that no longer gave them sufficient information to decide whether a carrot, for example, should be addressed as a “he” or a “she,” fell back on a radical and highly innovative idea, and started to call it an “it” instead. 
* So over a period of just a few generations, the original arbitrary gender system was replaced by a new one with transparent rules, whereby (almost) all inanimate objects came to be referred to simply as “it.”

Lera Boroditsky and Lauren Schmidt...
* asked a group of Spanish speakers and a group of German speakers to participate in a memory game (which was conducted wholly in English, in order to avoid any explicit mention of the genders). 
* The participants were given a list of two dozen inanimate objects, and for each of these objects, they had to memorize a person’s name. 
* For example, “apple” had the name Patrick associated with it, and “bridge” had the name Claudia. 
* The participants were given a fixed period of time to memorize the names associated with the objects, then tested on how well they had managed. 
* A statistical analysis of the results showed that they were better at remembering the assigned names when the gender of the object matched the sex of the person, and that they found it more difficult to remember the names when the gender of the object clashed with the sex of the person. 
* For example, Spanish speakers found it easier to remember the name associated with “apple” (la manzana) if it was Patricia rather than Patrick, and they found it easier to remember the name for a bridge (el puento) if it was Claudio rather than Claudia.

The evidence that has emerged so far leaves little doubt that the idiosyncrasies of a gender system exert a significant influence on speakers’ thoughts. 
* When a language treats inanimate objects in the same way as it treats women and men, with the same grammatical forms or with the same “he” and “she” pronouns, the habits of grammar can spill over to habits of mind beyond grammar.
* As before, the relevant difference between languages with and without a gender system is not in what they allow their speakers to convey but in what they habitually force their speakers to say.

Recall that Gladstone, Geiger, and Magnus believed that differences in the vocabulary of color resulted from preexisting differences in color perception. 
* But could it be that cause and effect have been reversed here? 
* Is it possible that linguistic differences can be the cause of differences in perception? 
* Could the color distinctions we routinely make in our language affect our sensitivity to certain colors? 
* Could our sensation of a Chagall painting or the stained-glass windows of Chartres cathedral depend on whether our language has a word for “blue”?

At first sight, an experiment involving speakers of only one language may seem a rather left-handed approach to testing whether the mother tongue makes a difference to speakers’ color perception.
* When the odd square out appeared on the right side of the screen, the half that is processed in the same hemisphere as language, the border between green and blue made a real difference.
    * The average reaction time was significantly shorter when the odd square out was across the green-blue border from the rest. 
    * But when the odd square out was on the left side of the screen, the effect of the green-blue border was far weaker. 
    * In other words, the speed of the response was much less influenced by whether the odd square out was across the green-blue border from the rest or whether it was a different shade of the same color. 
* So the left half of English speakers’ brains showed the same response toward the blue-green border that Russian speakers displayed toward the _siniy-goluboy_ border, whereas the right hemisphere showed only weak traces of a skewing effect. 
* The results of this experiment leave little room for doubt that the color concepts of our mother tongue interfere directly in the processing of color.
* When the brain has to decide whether two colors look the same or not, the circuits responsible for visual perception ask the language circuits for help in making the decision, even if no speaking is involved. 
* So for the first time, there is now direct neurophysiologic evidence that areas of the brain that are specifically responsible for name finding are involved with the processing of purely visual color information.

Although no one knows yet what exactly goes on between the linguistic and the visual circuits, the evidence gathered so far amounts to a compelling argument that language does affect our visual sensation. 
* Language is not a physical lens and does not affect the photons that reach the eye. 
* But the sensation of color is produced in the brain, not the eye, and the brain does not take the signals from the retina at face value, as 
* it is constantly engaged in a highly complex process of normalization, which creates an illusion of stable colors under different lighting conditions.
    * It has been shown, for instance, that a perfectly gray picture of a banana can appear slightly yellow to us, 
    * because the brain remembers bananas as yellow and so normalizes the sensation toward what it expects to see.
* In Kay and Kempton’s top-down experiment from 1984, English speakers insisted that shades across the green-blue border looked farther apart to them. 
    * The bottom-up approach of more recent experiments shows that the linguistic concepts of color are directly involved in the processing of visual information, and that 
    * they make people react to colors of different names as if these were farther apart than they are objectively.

But even if we have concluded the journey staring Gladstone right in the face, we are not entirely seeing eye to eye with him, because we have turned his story on its head and have reversed the direction of cause and effect in the relation between language and perception. 
* Gladstone assumed that the difference between Homer’s color vocabulary and ours was a result of preexisting differences in color perception. 
* But it now seems that the vocabulary of color in different languages can be the cause of differences in the perception of color.

No evidence has come to light that our mother tongue imposes limits on our intellectual horizons and constrains our ability to understand concepts or distinctions used in other languages. 
* The real effects of the mother tongue are rather the habits that develop through the frequent use of certain ways of expression. 
* All these habits of speech can create habits of mind that affect more than merely the knowledge of language itself, such as:
    * the concepts we are trained to treat as distinct, 
    * the information our mother tongue continuously forces us to specify, 
    * the details it requires us to be attentive to, and 
    * the repeated associations it imposes on us. 
 
We saw examples from three areas of language: 
* spatial coordinates and their consequences for memory patterns and orientation, 
* grammatical gender and its impact on associations, and 
* the concepts of color, which can increase our sensitivity to certain color distinctions.

These three examples... seem to me the areas where the impact of language has been demonstrated most convincingly so far. 
* Other areas have also been studied in recent years, but not enough reliable evidence has yet been presented to support them. One example is the marking of plurality. 
* While English requires its speakers to mark the difference between singular and plural whenever a noun is mentioned, there are languages that do not routinely force such a distinction. 
* It has been suggested that the necessity (or otherwise) to mark plurality affects the attention and memory patterns of speakers, but while this suggestion does not seem implausible in theory, conclusive evidence is still lacking.

When researching this book, I read quite a few latter-day arguments about the workings of the brain shortly after trawling through quite a few century-old discussions about the workings of biological heredity. 
* And when these are read in close proximity, it is difficult not to be struck by a close parallel between them. 
* What unites cognitive scientists at the turn of the twenty-first century and molecular biologists at the turn of the twentieth century is the profound ignorance about their object of investigation. 
* Around 1900, heredity was a black box even for the greatest of scientists.
* A century later, we can see much further into the mechanisms of genetics, but we are still just as shortsighted in all that concerns the workings of the brain.

When one hears about acts of extraordinary bravery in combat, it is usually a sign that the battle has not been going terribly well. 
* For when wars unfold according to plan and one’s own side is winning, acts of exceptional individual heroism are rarely called for. 
* Bravery is required mostly by the desperate side. 

The ingenuity and sophistication of some of the experiments we have encountered is so inspiring that it is easy to mistake them for signs of great triumphs in science’s battle to conquer the fortress of the human brain. 
* But, in reality, the ingenious inferences made in these experiments are symptoms not of great strength but of great weakness. 
* For all this ingenuity is needed only because we know so little about how the brain works. 
* Were we not profoundly ignorant, we would not need to rely on roundabout methods of gleaning information from measures such as reaction speed to various contrived tasks.
