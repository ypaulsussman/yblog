### Learning Analytics

- Analyze patterns in student performance, e.g.

  - Attendance in class
  - Participation in class
  - Participation in extracurriculars
  - Use of online resources
  - Use of library resources

- Aggregate the above data in new ways
- *Usage:* personalize instruction in large classes
- *Usage:* counsel students about best academic majors/paths
- *Usage:* early interventions for struggling students

### Adaptive Learning

- Several variants along gradient of “time cost to develop” vs “later flexibility”:

- ‘Closed’ system: premade adaptive logic and course content;
- ‘Open’ system: requires user to configure course content and adaptive logic;
- ‘Hybrid’ system: provides logic; user adds content (currently fastest-growing)

- *Usage:* eliminate need to ‘teach to the middle’ in larger courses
- Works better with factual, procedural knowledge than with higher-order/strategic knowledge (and is thus more appropriate to entry-level courses)

### Intelligent Tutoring Systems

- Different from other computer-training systems in two ways:

- Can interpret complex student responses (not merely worked examples, but the details of requests for assistance);
- Can learn as they operate (can build a profile for each student from that student’s work and requests, then use it to estimate their level of mastery in order to select future assignments).

- Current versions often work by breaking complex tasks down into sequences (or trees) of process-based steps, each requiring the student to provide some form of “work” (e.g. a diagram/equation/summary/etc.)
- One early discovery: struggling students should explain what they do understand to the tutor, who then can provide only enough hints for the student to work out the solution on their own (vs the traditional model of the tutor explaining or reexplaining the process via a different analogy, medium, level of detail, etc.)

### Other Notes/Ideas

- Competency-Based Education (in context of project-based learning that cultivates/advances open-educational content?)
- MOOC’s are currently experimenting with unbundling open-educational content: what technical affordances can help with the \[community-building, expert-feedback, and credentialing\] components of MOOC’s?
- Digital Humanities tasks (in collaboration with humanities academics) for bootcamp learn-to-code projects (as an alternative to the “build a CRUD app for this small NGO/business”)?
- More department chairs are looking beyond self-assessment, to portfolios in conjunction w/ student results, to measure the effectiveness of faculty development programs.
- Phrasing OEP in context of workforce-training: increased task authenticity as improved preparation for future jobs.
