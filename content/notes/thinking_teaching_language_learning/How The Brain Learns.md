### Basic Brain Facts, and How the Brain Processes Information

Minor wrinkles on the exterior of the brain are unique; major wrinkles compose the four lobes in each hemisphere:

1.  **Frontal lobes/Pre-frontal cortex**: “executive control center”; deals with planning and thinking; contains most working memory.
2.  **Temporal lobes**: deal with sound, face, and object recognition, and some long term memory; left side houses the speech centers; located directly above the ears
3.  **Occipital lobes**: at the lower back; almost exclusively for visual processing (_e.g. shapes and colors_)
4.  **Parietal lobes**: top and back; integrate sensory information and provide spatial orientation

Between the parietal and frontal lobes are two bands that run across the top of the brain from ear to ear:

1.  The frontal band is the **motor cortex** (_controls body movement_);
2.  the latter band is the **somatosensory cortex** (_processes touch signals._)

In the interior of the brain, four parts of the limbic system are important to learning and memory:

1.  The **thalamus** processes all incoming sensory information (_except smell_)
2.  The **hypothalamus** monitors internal systems and controls the release of a variety of hormones in order to maintain homeostasis
3.  The **hippocampus** uses electrical signals to convert information from working memory to long-term storage (_and is thus essential for consolidating learning_)
4.  The **amygdala** regulates and encodes the emotions, especially fear. (_Interactions between the amygdala and hippocampus thus ensure that we remember important/emotional events for a long time._)

Of the 12 body nerves that go to the brain, 11 end in the **brainstem** (_the olfactory nerve goes directly to the limbic system._)

The brain has about 1 trillion cells of two types: 
1. **nerve cells** (_neurons, of which there are 100 billion_) and 
2. **glial cells** (_which hold neurons together and filter harmful substances_)

Messages move along the neuron electrically, but between neurons chemically.

Some neurons fire just prior to carrying out a planned movement, but also when watching someone else perform the same movement: these are called **mirror neurons**. They allow us to understand others’ emotions and empathize.

Information is stored if two conditions are met: one, that the information can be understood; and two, that the information is meaningful. (_Always ask these two questions about content: is the student able to process it? And do you explain why the student should process it?_)

Generate interest in content before teaching it; this will cause the working memory to seek ways to use this new content.

Clearly establish assessment times/rubrics at the beginning of the session: when learners believe they will be held accountable, processing time increases.

Formative assessments (_frequent brief quizzes that are carefully corrected and returned promptly_) are much more valuable and effective learning tools than summative assessment.

### Memory, Retention, and Learning

**Long-term potentiation** is the process of neighboring neurons “firing together and wiring together.”

Memories are stored in pieces and distributed in sites throughout the cerebrum; activating these sites simultaneously brings together a memory.

There are three stages of memories: sensory/immediate memory, working memory, and long-term memory. 

Long-term memory is broken into two major types:
1.  **Declarative/conscious/explicit memory** is processed by the hippocampus and cerebrum; it includes
    1.  episodic memory (_memory of events in our own life history_) and
    2.  semantic memory (_knowledge of the facts, images, and words._)
2.  **Nondeclarative/implicit memory** describes all memories that cannot be explained in any straightforward manner; it includes
    1.  procedural memory (_motor and cognitive skills: how to do something_),
    2.  the perceptual representation system (_the ability to complete fragments of words or determine whether depicted objects could exist in the real world_),
    3.  classical conditioning (_associative learning_), and
    4.  nonassociative learning (_habituation, or learning not to respond to things that don’t require conscious attention; and sensitization, or increasing response-levels to particularly threatening stimuli._)

Two forms of rehearsal:

1.  **Rote rehearsal,** for when information must be stored exactly as it is entered, and
2.  **Elaborative rehearsal,** when priority is instead on associating the new learnings with prior learning to detect relationships and assign meaning. 

Students use rote rehearsal to memorize a poem, but elaborative rehearsal to interpret its message.

The **primacy-recency effect** states that we tend to remember the first item in a sequence best and the last item second-best when learning.

As lesson time lengthens, the percentage of downtime increases faster than the percentage of prime-times (_at the beginning and end of the lesson._) See Elliott, Isaac, and Muhlert, 2014.

Teacher lecture results in the lowest student retention; it involves verbal processing with little active participation or mental rehearsal. A recent modification of the lecture format (_interactive lecture and direct teaching_) has had better results; it requires the students to provide periodic feedback on what they have learned spaced throughout the lesson.

Effective practice starts with massed practice (_for fast learning_) and proceeds to distributed practice later for retention: thus each test should not only query new material, but also allow students to practice important older content.

The **gradual release of responsibility** teaching model proceeds from
1.  focused instruction (_“I do it; you watch”_) to
2.  guided instruction (_“we do it”_) to
3.  collaborative learning (_“you do it together”_) to
4.  independent tasks (_“you do it alone.”_)

Recent research is revealing how remarkably integrated brain activity is when performing even the simplest task.

Encoding information into memory involves the left hemisphere more than the right; retrieval, the opposite.

It takes less than 50 milliseconds to retrieve an item from working memory; retrieval from long-term storage is comparatively time-consuming.

Whenever a previously-consolidated memory is recalled into working memory, it is vulnerable to alteration by any information already in working memory (_a process called reconsolidation._)

Rate of learning (_the speed with which information is encoded from working to long-term memory_) is independent of rate of retrieval: moreover, rate of retrieval is a learned skill that can be taught and improved.

**Chunking** occurs when working memory perceives a set of data as a single item; it allows us to consciously increase the number of items that working memory can handle simultaneously.
