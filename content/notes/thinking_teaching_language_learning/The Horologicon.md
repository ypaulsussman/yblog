The Horologicon (or book of hours) contains the most extraordinary words in the English language, arranged according to what hour of the day you might need them.\")"

In medieval times there were books of hours [or **Horologicons**] all over the place. They were filled with prayers so that, at any time of day, the pious priest could whip out his horologicon, flip to the appropriate page and offer up an orison to St. Pantouffle, or whoever happened to be holy at the time.

To **feague** a horse... [is] to put ginger a horse’s fundament, and formerly, as it is said, a live eel, to make him lively and carry his tail well; it is said, a forfeit is incurred by any horse-dealer’s servant, who shall show a horse without first feaguing him. Feague is used, figuratively, for encouraging or spiriting one up.

[**Uhtceare**] is a single Old English word meaning “lying awake before dawn and worrying.” _Uht_ (pronounced _oot_) is the restless hour before the dawn, [and] _Ceare_ (pronounced _key-are-a_) was the Old English word for care and sorrow, emotions that have an annoying habit of striking during the _uht._

...the **antelucan** [or before-dawn] hush... 

...your posture in bed (technically called your **decubitus**)...

[A] **low dawn** is when the sun appears straight over the horizon; [a] **high dawn** is when it is, at first, obscured by clouds and then pops out suddenly in its glorious nuclear-fusive majesty farther up in the sky.

...people who are breezy and bright in the morning [are] **matutinal.**

[A] **zwodder** [is] “A drowsy and stupid state of body or mind.”

Your arm has fallen asleep, a condition that the medical world refers to as **obdormition.** The only way to cure this is to wave the said limb about... until the **prinkling** starts and your blood slowly, reluctantly resumes...

**pandiculation** ...is the stretching of the arms and body characteristic of this mournful yawnful time.

**Whindling** is defined in a dictionary of 1699 as “feigned groaning.”

**Pantofles** [slippers] are named after Saint Pantouffle, who is as obscure as he is fictional. He (or she, or it) appears to have been invented in France in the fifteenth century.

[A] **gowpen** of water—i.e. a double handful—

[For "the restroom"]... The Victorians would **visit my aunt**... in the thirteenth century they would **visit a chamber foreign,** or in the eighteenth century you could **take a voyage to the Spice Islands**... **House of office** has a pleasing grandeur to it, although some... would have called it a **House of Commons**.

“to lay a bottle on its side for some time... that it may be completely drained of the few drops remaining.” [was known as] **making the bottle confess**

**Inguinal** [is] relating to the groin

...the Victorians called [a neckbeard] a **Newgate fringe**. Newgate was the name of a London prison where people were hanged.

**sky-clad** [was old English for nudity, often ritual] 

What the Victorians coyly referred to as **one’s abbreviations** [is] in these coarse times is simply called underwear.

A **grinnow** is a stain that has not come out in the wash

A **tatterdemalion** is a chap (or chappess) whose clothes are tattered and torn.

The Greek for breakfast was _ariston_, so the study of breakfast is **aristology**, and those who devote their lives to the pursuit of the perfect morning meal are **aristologists**.

[_Side note:_] there is a whole book of the Iliad—the nineteenth—devoted to the subject of whether or not to eat breakfast. ...Achilles, for example, would never have seen a chicken or a hen’s egg, as they weren’t imported to Europe until the fifth century B.C.,

**brizzled** [is] “scorched near to burning.”

A **Spitalfields breakfast**, at the East end of London... is understood as consisting of a tight necktie and a short pipe.

euphemisms for being hanged [include to] **dance upon nothing with a hempen necktie**, **caper in the wind* or **have a hearty choke and caper sauce for breakfast**

[In] ancient Greece, they had a special slave called an **analecta** whose job was to gather up the breadcrumbs after a meal. _Ana_ meant “up” and _lectos_ meant “gathered.” That’s why the gathered up sayings of Confucius are called The Analects...

[_Side note:_] When a death sentence is commuted to life imprisonment, it’s a good thing. However, commuting is uniformly awful. The connection... is that both involve a **commutual exchange.** The noose is exchanged for the cell... in nineteenth-century America individual purchases of railway tickets could be exchanged for one commutation ticket at a slightly reduced rate, that was valid for a year.

**Swale**: windy, cold, bleak.

**Thwankin**: used of clouds, mingling in thick and gloomy succession.

**Golgotha** ...was the Victorian slang term for a hat, on the basis that, as it says in Mark’s Gospel: _And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull._

dirty rainwater (once known as **dog’s soup**)

your shoes filled with water so that you can actually hear it sloshing and squeezing between your toes. There is a word for making this noise: **chorking**

**daggled** [is] muddied at the hemline.

**backsters** ...are the planks of wood laid out over soft mud

**Chariot buzzers** are pickpockets who work on buses, but as the term is Victorian

**Have among you, you blind harpers** ...an expression used in throwing or shooting at random among the crowd.

the **barracoon** [is a barracks used historically for the temporary confinement of slaves or criminals, usually before transport elsewhere]

A **latrocinium** is, technically speaking, a robber-council. The word was first applied to the Second Council of Ephesus, a grand meeting of the fifth-century church to decide upon the exact nature of Christ and who should therefore be burnt. It was so riotous, raucous and disagreeable that the Pope declared the whole thing null and void...

[_Side note:_] Evelyn Waugh, in his later years, used to have an ear trumpet. It probably wasn’t even necessary, but he would hold it conspicuously to his ear, shell-like during conversations, and, when he was bored, would just as conspicuously put it back in his pocket, sometimes while you were in mid-sentence.

**Nod-crafty** is defined in the OED as “Given to nodding the head with an air of great wisdom.”

**mumbudget** a lovely old phrase for keeping quiet.

[One expression of skepticism, or one's own worldliness and experience was] **“I’ve seen the elephant, chum,”** a reference to the fact that the travelling circuses of Victorian England had made elephants commonplace to all but the most bumpkinish of rustics. 

“No” can be rendered by the enigmatic expression **“Saw your timber.”**

**controver** an obsolete word for an “inventor of false gossip.”

**Will ye raise a Cloud** [is to ask] shall we Smoke a Pipe?

**a straight** [is a] manufactured cigarette [while] a **quirly** [is one that] you roll yourself.

“bad, or rank tobacco,” also called **old rope.**

**Hard-ups** [were] cigar-end finders, who collect the refuse pieces of smoked cigars from the gutter, and having dried them, sell them as tobacco to the very poor.

**Sprezzatura** [is a] sort of means nonchalance, but more precisely it means the appearance of nonchalance—the effort made to disguise the fact that you’re making an effort.

As gold and silver and diamonds are always found underground, the ancients decided that Pluto was also the god of money, hence **plutomania**, plutocracy and **plutolatry** (worship of wealth).

[A] **barker** ...was the Victorian term for somebody who stood outside a shop shouting its virtues into the smoggy air.

**Chuff it** i.e., be off, or take it away, in answer to a street seller who is importuning you to purchase.

A **screever** is a professional writer of begging letters. These letters would not be sent, rather they would be given to somebody else who would use them as a sort of certificate of authenticity as they told their hard luck story.

(a **jobler** is somebody who does small jobs).

**sardonian** is... “one who flatters with deadly intent.” The reason for this odd and unusually precise word is not a person but a plant. The _herba sardonia_ was said to cause horrible facial convulsions that resembled laughter, followed by death.

...calculated **glavering** and flattery...

**Spanish money** ...is an old term for “fair words and compliments.”

One way to enter into a career as a **scambler** is to **groke**, which is to stare wistfully at somebody while they are eating in the hope that they will give you some of their food. Groking was originally applied only to dogs...

To **pingle** is to push food around your plate without really eating much of it.

**Noon** was originally the ninth, or in Old English non, hour after dawn, which averages it out as three o’clock.

To **snudge along**: to walk looking downward, and poring, as though the Head was full of Business.

[_Side note:_] Dr. Bell insisted that all phone calls should begin with the words “Ahoy, ahoy.” Nobody knows why he insisted this—he had no connection to the navy—but insist he did and started every phone call that way. Nobody else did, and it was at the suggestion of his great rival Edison that people took to saying “Hello.”

**micher** being, according to Dr. Johnson’s dictionary, “A lazy loiterer, who skulks about in corners and by-places, and keeps out of sight; a hedge creeper.”

**latibulate** meaning “hide in a corner.”

The **drogulus** was invented as a purely theoretical concept by the British philosopher A. J. Ayer. Ayer is a chap who deserves everybody’s respect and time, if not for his thought, then at least for the fact that he once, at the age of 77, stopped Mike Tyson from attacking a young model called Naomi Campbell. It was at a party in New York, and when Ayer got in the way Mike Tyson asked him: “Do you know who the fuck I am? I’m the heavyweight champion of the world.” To which Ayer replied: “And I am the former Wykeham Professor of Logic. We are both pre-eminent in our field. I suggest that we talk about this like rational men.” Meanwhile, Miss Campbell had slipped away. But to return to the drogulus: this fascinating little speculative creature was invented in a less glamorous argument in 1949 when Ayer was debating with a priest about meaningful and meaningless statements. Ayer contended that a statement could be meaningful only if you could state what would prove that it was true or false. So “God exists” would be a meaningful statement only if you could say definitively what would make you believe or disbelieve it: _...And you say, “Well how am I to tell if it’s there or not?” And I say, “There’s no way of telling. Everything’s just the same if it’s there or it’s not there. But the fact is it’s there.”_

On April 1 junior employees used to be sent out to buy **pigeon milk** for their masters. Every shopkeeper would direct them onwards to somewhere just round the corner and they could wander around town all day on this sleeveless errand.

[_Side note:_] When Ghengis Khan seized Bukhara he gathered all the city’s most prominent citizens to kneel before him and began his pep talk thus: I am the punishment of God. If you had not committed great sins, God would not have sent a punishment like me upon you.

[_Side note:_] Percy Bysshe Shelley was expelled from Oxford for writing a tract called The Necessity of Atheism, signed “Thro’ deficiency of proof, AN ATHEIST.” But in private he freely admitted that he was a theist, by which he meant nothing in the way of religion, only that he was addicted to tea (French thé).

[_Side note:_] In the nineteenth century, when photography was still in nappies, exposure times were so long that people who were walking would be blurred. They would have ghosts flowing out behind them. It was this that introduced the idea in paintings and drawings that movement could be indicated by lines flying out behind a moving object. Photography changed our visual ideas and that changed representations in other mediums.

**skeuomorph** is a technological limitation that is deliberately imitated even when it’s no longer necessary.

[An] **eschaton** which is the correct term for the rumpus that precedes the end of the world. If you’re being very strict about things an apocalypse is not the end of the world, it is merely a vision of the eschaton. So The Apocalypse of Saint John the Divine, commonly known as the Book of Revelation, is just that: a revelation, or apocalypse, of what will happen when God finally calls time on this sorry mess we call existence.

[_Side note:_] Oderic Vitalis (1075–1142), in his Historia Ecclesiastica, recounts a story about a monk who was surprisingly sinful, but also a very devoted scribe. When he died they counted up all the words that he had ever written and found that they outnumbered all the sins that he had ever committed, by a total of one. He therefore went to heaven. 

[_Side note:_] Hermann the Recluse [_according to legend, a thirteenth century Benedictine monk from Bohemia best known as the supposed author of the Codex Gigas, or Devil's Bible_] struck a deal whereby he could expiate his guilt by writing the biggest book in the whole wide world in a single night. He set to work, but like many writers who signed their contract thinking that it would be easy, he discovered the deadline charging towards him like a herd of elephants. He then struck a second deal... The Devil agreed to help him write the book, but only in exchange for Hermann’s soul. Deal done, the book was produced in a single night, after which Hermann tried to strike a third deal giving him forgiveness and salvation, this time with the Virgin Mary, who, I suppose, happened to be around. However, just before he could sign on the dotted line, he died and went to Hell. The book that was produced survives to this day. It’s called the Codex Gigas and is kept in the National Library of Sweden. It’s just under a metre tall, half a metre wide, and twenty centimetres thick. It weighs slightly more than I do, and its parchment reputedly contains the skins of 160 donkeys.

**eleutheromania** [is] “a crazed desire for freedom.”

When the planet Venus shines at dusk, it becomes Hesperus, the evening star. And if you pronounce the H as a V you get the evening service of the church: vespers. From that you get **vespertine** (belonging to the evening)...

**Scamander**, by the way, is the sister verb of meander. The river Maeander winds, by a preposterously curly-whirly route, through Izmir in Turkey. ...the Scamander [is] another Turkish watercourse now known as the Karamenderes... [which] wound mazily across the windy plain before the walls of Troy, and is where Achilles did some of his best killing.

**sauntry** ...is the act of sauntering, and perhaps the closest native equivalent to flânerie.

Shopping malls rarely have any windows on the outside. There is a good reason for this: if you could see the world beyond the window you would be able to orientate yourself and might not get lost. Shopping malls have maps that are unreadable even to the most skilled cartographer. There is a good reason for this: if you could read the map you would be able to find your way to the shop you meant to go to without getting lost. this strange mental process, this freeing of the mind from all sense of purpose or reason, is known to retail analysts as the **Gruen transfer**. ...It is the combination of sensory overload and spatial amazement that means you buy many more things than you meant to and thus keep the whole place profitable.

A **“tailor’s mense,”** ration, or allowance, is, according to an old saying, a small portion of a meal left for good manners, only one-ninth part of the quantity required for a man.

**quafftide** ...is a lovely old term meaning the time of drinking (rather like eventide or morningtide, but a lot more damaging to the liver).

[English still has the] [frequentative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentative), as _sparkle_ is of _spark_ or _gobble_ is of _gob_.

[A] **Snake-room** [is] a side room of a basement where saloon-keepers accommodate doped or drunken people until they recover their senses, presumably a place where they “see snakes.”

[_Side note:_] When the Aztecs fermented the sap of the maguey plant (or _agave americana_) they got a milky-looking drink called _pulque_, which got them nice and tiddly. Therefore, in Aztec mythology, when Mayahuel, the goddess of the maguey plant, married Patecatl, the god of fermentation, she gave birth to four hundred divine rabbits, which she fed from her four hundred divine breasts. [As such] the Aztecs measured drunkenness in rabbits. Fifteen rabbits was, apparently, ideal. But if you were four hundred rabbits then you were completely gone.

**dragging time** [is] helpfully defined in the _Dictionary of Obsolete and Provincial English_ as “The evening of a fair day when the lads pull the wenches about.”

**fleshling**, which the OED defines, rather coyly, as “a fleshly minded person.”

_Picarone_ is Spanish for a thief, but this phrase [**"out on the picaroon"**] does not necessarily mean anything dishonest but ready for anything in the way of excitement to turn up; also to be in search of anything profitable.

To **smicker** is “to look amorously or wantonly at or after a person,” usually after, of course, although a glossary of medieval Scottish poetry... says that to smikker is to “smile in a seducing manner.”

[_Side note:_] the Greeks would commission all sorts of sculptures of callipygian Venus in which the main purpose was to make her as lovely-bottomed as possible. Lucian of Samosata records seeing one such statue carved by the greatest sculptor of antiquity: Praxiteles. This statue, apparently, was rather too good. So sexy was Aphrodite’s posterior that a young man was discovered in the temple committing enthusiastic blasphemy with the marble goddess. He was rather embarrassed by this, as I suppose you would be, and cast himself into the sea.

**Accismus** is a rhetorical term meaning pretended lack of interest in that which you keenly desire.

A man fetched from the tavern or ale-house by his wife, is said to be **arrested by the white sergeant.**

To **go agatewards with anyone** [is] to accompany him part of his way home, which was formerly the last office of hospitality towards a guest, frequently necessary even now for guidance and protection in some parts of the country. Gate here is an old term for the public highway. So if you walked somebody agatewards you would accompany them along the dark, narrow, unfrequented lanes where robbers lurked, and then part with them at the wide open highway...

[A] **moon-curser** [is] a boy who would walk beside you carrying a torch and lighting your way.

**The wheady mile** is a very useful concept, defined in Nathan Bailey’s _Universal Etymological Dictionary_ of 1721 as “A Mile beyond Expectation, a tedious one. Shropshire.” It’s that last bit of a journey that goes on much longer than you had planned.

**vespilone** “he that carries forth dead bodies in the night to be buried, as they use in time of plague and great sickness,” with his... his **corpse-hooks**, his **eternity box** and his **danna-drag** [from "dunny," or feces] on which the waste of the city is carried out.

**sheep bed** i.e. the grass.

[_Side note:_] the Lord of Nijo Castle in Kyoto [had] **the nightingale floor**. all the floorboards were specially designed to squeak when you walked on them, meaning that you couldn’t surprise anybody in their bed. In fact, the squeakings were specifically designed to be rather melodious and sound like nightingales. There was an intricate system of nails and brackets beneath each corridor, and even though the results were rather approximate, it was possible to imagine that there was an aviary of indignant birds beneath your feet.

[People who] only truly awake after midnight are called **lychnobites**. Lychnobite comes from the Greek _lychno-bios_ and means, approximately, “lamp-life”

**Lucubrate** means to work by lamp-light

**Paralipsis** is the practice of mentioning that you’re not mentioning something, and saying what you’re not saying.

**Epitrope** is the granting of ironic permission, usually while listing all of the concomitant disadvantages. Consider the following: Go right ahead. Don’t mind me. Really, don’t. Stay out late. Ruin your liver. It doesn’t bother me that you’re heading for an early grave and I’m going to be left bankrupt and alone with seventeen children and a wooden leg. Why should that bother me?

Highwaymen could never say anything in ordinary English, and they would bid you good night by saying **bene darkmans**, pronounced _BEN-ay_, and deriving from the Latin for blessed.
