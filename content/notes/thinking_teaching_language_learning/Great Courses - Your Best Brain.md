## Your Best Brain

### Lecture 1: How Your Brain Works
- Two nervous systems in the body; we'll focus solely on former:
  - Central nervous system (brain and spinal cord)
  - Peripheral nervous system (everythign else)
- Humans developed outsized brains in order to manage societal complexity.
- Diverged from chimpanzees 8mya
- Climate changed from wetter rainforest to drier savannah, esp. ~205kya (about the time _Homo Sapiens_ emerged)

### Lecture 2: Your Unique Thinking Abilities
- Variability Selection Theory (VST) posits that humans became apex predators because of their ability to adapt to change itself (during a time when climate varied wildly, at least on a generational scale)
- Many evolutionary biologists believe the emergence of language was the development that allowed humans to adapt this rapidly.
- What allowed for language? Symbolic reasoning.
- Theory of mind possibly generated symbolic reasoning
  - ToM: ability to understand motivations and intentions of another person, and to understand that they may not be the same as yours 
  - ToM indicated via Sally-Anne test (_"Where will Sally look for the marble?"_)

### Lecture 3: Damaged Brain, Damaged Function
- "The mind" is an emergent property, arising from the interaction of electricity and flesh.
- Brain constructed like an archaeological site: recent evolutions piled on top of earlier structures.
- Ridges are _gyri_ /jaɪraɪ/; valleys are _sulci_ /sl-kaɪ/; both exist in order to expand the brain's surface area (its cerebral cortex)
- Forebrain:
  - Cortex
    - _cortex_ is Latin for "bark"
    - Has four lobes:
      - Occipital lobe is in back; responsible for vision
      - Parietal lobe is top-center; responsible for sensory signals (touch, pain, etc)
      - Temporal lobes are on each side; responsible for memory
      - Frontal lobe includes the Prefrontal cortex
        - Prefrontal cortex is the front, behind the forehead; youngest part of the brain; responsible for most "human" thinking processes (cognitive functions; emotional regulation)
    - Thin: ~2-4mm thick on average
  - Limbic system
    - Underneath layer of cortex
    - Amygdalae are responsible for emotional processing
    - Hippocampi are responsible for memory formation
    - Fornix connects memory to regions of the brain
    - Thalamus ingests incoming sensory information and routes it to regions of the brain
    - Hypothalamus is responsible for fear, hunger, sex drive
  - Corpus callosum connects the two hemispheres to communicate
- Midbrain:
  - Embedded inside the brain stem (which connects brain to spinal column)
  - Responsible for maintaining arousal/awareness (e.g. sleep regulation, consciousness)
- Hindbrain:
  - Also embedded in the brain stem
  - Regulates respiration, heartrate
  - Includes Cerebellum, which coordinates muscular movement (among other things)

### Lecture 4: Neuroplasticity: Your Flexible Brain
- Three categories of brain wirings:
  - Experience-independent circuits
    - Formed before birth
    - e.g. regulating heartbeats, respiration
  - Experience-expectant circuits
    - Brain is internally hardwired to expect some input; it then finishes the wiring
    - e.g. vision (not fully developed at birth; requires photic exposure)
  - Experience-dependent circuits
- Brain uses a single electrochemical language to perceive our world, by 'translating' light, air vibrations, airborne molecules, etc
- Two categories of cells in the brain:
  - Neuron 
    - ~10% of the cells
    - Contains several components
      - Nucleus
      - Dendrites
      - Axon
        - Myelin sheath
        - Axon terminal
  - Glial cells
    - ~90% of the cells
    - Involved in information processing
    - Variety of shapes/sizes
      - Astrocytes
      - Microglial cells (immune functions inside skull)
- Neuronal communication
  - A synaptic cleft is the watery space between two neurons
  - The sendin (presynaptic) neuron conveys its message neuron by releasing neurotransmitters (biochemicals)
  - The neurotransmitters bind to matching receptors on the receiving (postsynaptic) neuron
  - Enough such bindings tell the postsynaptic neuron to fire an electrochemical charge 
    - This charge is called the neuron's action potential
    - The name derives from temporary change in the electric potential on the cell's surface, as the charge propagates down the axon to the neuron's terminus 
    - Arrival at this terminus usually results in the neuron dispatching its own neurotransmitters
  - After this firing, the neuron enters its absolute refractory period, wherein no electrochemical stimulation will cause it to fire
  - The neurotransmitters are then released from the receptors (reuptake)
- Hebbian wiring
  - When two proximal neurons fire repeatedly, molecular alterations occur in both, resulting in a stronger electrical connection
  - This usually occurs at a scale of far more than two neurons at a time
  - This repeated firing is what creates organized neural circuits
  - This is how external experiences shape the internal structures of the brain

### Lecture 5: How Your Brain Uses Memory
- Models for in measuring intelligence
  - Spearman's g-factor 
    - Tests measure positive statistical correlations on a wide series of tasks
    - Successfully predicts academic / job performance
    - Correlation between twins raised in same household: .86; raised separately, .75 (e.g. genes have large, but not sole, influence)
  - Crystallized and fluid intelligence
    - Crystallized: ability to learn from experience (efficiently constructing a retrievable database; rapid memorization; improves with age)
    - Fluid: ability to creatively apply the knowledge in that database (pattern-matching / inductive reasoning / problem-solving; rapid improvisation; slowly decreases after early 20's)

### Lecture 6: The Advantages of Forgetting
- In the brain, multiple memory systems
  - Semantic information processing: e.g. memorizing lists of words
  - Semantic autobiographical memory: e.g. what you ate for lunch on September 05th, 2015
- Sequence of creating long-term memory:
  - Encoding: processing from e.g. audio/visual data into electrical language that neurons can understand
  - Storing: creating permanent record of those electrical patterns
    - First step: encode into temporary buffer (formerly called "short-term memory"; now called "working memory")
    - Second step: form long-term memory 'traces' in networks distributed across far-flung regions in your brain
  - Retrieving: returning the pattern back into conscious awareness
- Two large categories of memory:
  - Declarative memory contains...
    - facts: "semantic memory" 
    - experiences: "episodic memory"
  - Non-declarative memory (also called "procedural" or "implicit" memory) contains memories that can't be verbally communicated
- Retrieval fallibility
  - Two ways that memories are retrieved:
    - Reproductive retrieval is calling up a memory almost immediately after it was experienced (the memory's components are still largely cohesive)
    - Reconstructive retrieval occurs some time later, after the components of the memory have begun to decohere and perhaps overlap with other memories' constituents
  - Latter is hypothesized to have evolved b/c, evolutionarily speaking, we don't need perfect memory: in the biological time-frame, we use memory as as scaffold for envisioning and planninga about the future, not for perfectly retaining information

### Lecture 7: Creativity and Fluid Intelligence
- Fluid intelligence: ability to solve novel situations for which prior experience does not supply a prescription
- Creativity may involve the balance between...
  - Cognitive disinhibition: failure to disregard information that is "irrelevant" to the purported goal (e.g. finding new uses for tools)
  - Latent inhibition: ability to block out/filter options in pursuit of a goal
- Working memory (per Alan Baddley)
  - Consists of two subsystems, each themselves containing two subsystems:
    - Phonological loop neurons (process any info that is auditory and verbal)
      - Temporary storage
      - Retrieval
    - Visual-spatial sketchpad neurons (process any info that is visual)
      - Object memory store (color and shape)
      - Spatial store (objects' spatial distribution and motion)
  - These subsystems are managed by a 'central executive' system
    - Directs focus and targets information (that is, controls attention)
    - Ensures working memory and long-term memory coordinate/work together

### Lecture 8: How Your Brain Uses Your Senses
- Sensation 
  - The body's response to an outside stimulus
  - Three steps to produce:
    - Initiation: sensory receptor is activated
    - Transduction: sensory apparatus converts whatever energy composes the stimulus into specific electrical patterns that the brain can understand
    - Routing: electrical patterns are sent to the brain (many to the thalamus); 
      - Routing involves a variety of specialized "feature detector" modules in the brain deconstructing, processing, and reconstructing each stimulus, 
      - e.g. for an image? The round, diagonal, and circular shapes inside incoming visual data will all be processed by different parts of the brain (as will color, and any semantic categories.)
- Perception
  - Follows sensation; it's the process of the brain assigning meaning to these disparate electrical patterns
  - Two steps:
    - Bottom-up processing: combining the atomic, separate features of a stimulus into a unified, meaningful perception
    - Top-down processing: comparing (and even altering) the now-unified perception with [previously-stored information, expectations, etc]
- Multisensory processing
  - Most real-world inputs simultaneously stimulate multiple sensory receptors
  - Senses interfere w/ each other, e.g. McGurk effect (overdub someone saying "ga" with someone saying "ba" and the brain won't hear "ba")

### Lecture 9: Seeing with Your Brain: Vision
- 1/3 to 1/2 of brain is dedicated to processing images
- The eye shakes 200+ times/second
  - When focusing, ~120 times/second
  - These are _saccades_
  - They're crucial to vision; without them, you can't perceive whether [an object, the environment, and/or you yourself] are moving
  - The brain engages in _saccadic suppresion_ to create the illusion of stability
- Process of "seeing":
  - The _retina_ is a thin layer of neural tissue painted on the inside of the back of the eye 
    - It performs _transduction_ to transform photons of light into chemical impulses
    - Retinal cells gather at the _optic disc_ before projecting to occipital lobe
      - This disc has no photoreceptors: so the image the occipital lobe receives is not only upside-down and backwards, but also has a hole in its center
      - The _filling in_ process occurs by the occipital lobe combining data from each eye, then using that to compensate inside the other eye's blindspot
  - The _optic nerve_ directs these chemical impulses 
    - First to the _thalamus_, 
    - Then to the _occipital lobe_ (specifically, the V1 region of the visual cortex)
  - Inside the lobe, different _feature detectors_ deconstruct and process the different parts of the image (circular elements, vertical lines, specific light wavelengths, etc)
  - The lobe then performs _stream separation,_ reconstructing these components into two streams:
    - The _ventral stream_ (the "what", e.g. an object's shape or taxonomy)
    -  The _dorsal stream_ (the "where", e.g. an object's location and movement)
  - The _binding problem_ or _combination problem_ is that we don't yet actually know how these streams are reconciled into the unified, holistic image.
- The _pictorial superiority effect_ (that is, images' superlative utility as pedagogical tools) has been demonstrated since the 1970's

### Lecture 10: Feeling with Your Brain: Emotion
- Sequence of emotion generation:
  - Sensory input first hits the Thalamus
  - The thalamus sends it: 
    - To the Amygdalae (via the "fast path"), which tag/associate each sensory input with an emotion (this occurs unconsciously); and
    - To the Frontal Cortex (via the "slow path"), which consciously processes each input, before routing them to the Amygdalae.
  - As such, your body may begin responding to an input's emotion (via the first Amygdalae-hit) before you're consciously aware of the input
  - The Amygdalae also dispatch signals to the Hypothalamus (which is responsible for sensations of "the four F's")
- Peripheral nervous system has two components:
  - Somatic nervous system (voluntary muscle movements)
  - Autonomic nervous system (unconscious bodily processes)
- "Emotionally-competent stimuli" trigger reactions in:
  - Autonomic nervous system (e.g. add extra energy)
  - Endocrine system (dump hormones like Cortisol in bloodstream)
  - Skeletal-muscular system (for subconscious fight/flight/freeze behavior)

### Lecture 11: How Emotion Drives Attention
- Attention: "the tool our brain deploys to select a subset of competing stimuli for further study"
- "Feelings" require conscious awareness; "emotions" do not: and the latter are what can inform attention
- "Central executive" system (see Lecture 07) located in two regions:
  - Prefrontal cortext (most recently-evolved section of the brain) reminds brain of its current goals (i.e. sets goals for attention-filters)
  - Basal Ganglia (normally manages movement/motor tasks) filters out mental (as well as muscle) commands (i.e. inhibits distracting information)

### Lecture 12: Pleasure and Your Brain
- Two regions responsible for mediating pleasure/reward sensations:
  - Nucleus Accumbens (two knots of neural tissue just above the eyes) 
  - Ventral Tegmental Area (behind and below the Nucleus Accumbens)
