### Practicing Mindfulness: An Introduction to Meditation

#### Lecture 1: Mindlessness - The Default Setting
- Our minds, when allowed by routine not to focus on the task at hand, will fixate either on the past or the future: or, alternatively, will pass judgments on the proximal environment.
- Our minds are plastic, however: they can be conditioned/redirected to behave differently. 

#### Lecture 2: Mindfulness - The Power of Awareness
- 'Mindlessness': ordinary mental state of habit and inattention
- 'Mindfulness': 
  - moment-by-moment awareness; 
  - process of attentively observing your experience as it unfolds, without judgment or comparisons;
  - recognition of each thought as a momentary event that passes through the mind.

#### Lecture 3: Expectations - Relinquishing Preconceptions
- We'll return to the concept of relinquishment several times
- Bhavana, or "cultivation," is closer to mindfulness practice than "meditation" -- it's not about ruminating deeply

#### Lecture 5: Position - Where to Be for Meditation
- Lotus position is preferred, but starting with a cushion or chair is fine as well
- Important part is the back: straight but not rigid, with slight curvature: imagine string at crown of skull, pulling spine upwards
- Lengthen backbone, while drawing shoulders down and toward the spine
- Hands can be in lap, one on the other, with thighs bearing their weight; alternatively, on the knees (palms down or up) -- choose whatever allows you to be still for the longest period
- Let jaw, then lips, then tongue gently relax
- Eyes can be open or closed; if closed, focus at point on the ground ~6' away

#### Lecture 6: Breathing - Finding a Focus for Attention
- Fine to shift body if e.g. foot falls asleep: but do so intentionally, with mindfulness
- Begin by silently acknowledging intention to practice mindfulness
- Use the breath as the anchor for attention: begin by focusing on it, and return to it when you realize you've become distracted
- Can be distracted by thoughts, or sensations: for the former, simply observe "thinking"; the latter, "feeling." After, return attention to movement/cycle of the breath
- _ekgrata,_ or "one-pointedness," is what we're aiming for here, eventually: learning to concentrate. First step, though, is mere awareness of when one fails to concentrate
- The mindfulness tradition holds that boredom is not caused by our circumstances: rather, it's the product of inattention, the result of withdrawing our full attention from what's happening at the moment.

#### Lecture 7: Problems - Stepping-Stones to Mindfulness
- Pain: an unpleasant sensation
- Suffering: a mental/emotional response (which may or may not be associated with pain)
  - The belief that "pain shouldn't happen to us" is a common cause of suffering
  - This is delusional, inconsistent with the nature of the world
- When you experience pain, during meditation: 
  - First, simply attempt to eliminate it (looser clothes, different cushion)
  - If unfeasible, simply observe: draw your attention to the pain, and investigate it. 
    - Become a bystander; notice its qualities, and impermanence
    - This works for e.g. itches, too (if the itch doesn't subside, it's OK to scratch! But do so deliberately, with mindfulness)
- To regain concentration:
  - Take deeper breaths (inhaling/exhaling more forcibly), thereby giving your attention a more-prominent item to focus on
  - Count 1-5 (or 1-10) while inhaling; count 5-1 (10-1) while exhaling
  - Count 1 while inhaling, 2 while exhaling, etc, up to e.g. 10 (or more)

#### Lecture 8: Body - Attending to Our Physical Natures
- Mindfulness of the breath (introduced prior) is one form of mindfulness meditation. Another: the body scan.
- Here, rather than directing attention to inhalation/exhalation, directing attention to specific parts of the body.
- Body scan can be practiced either sitting or lying down (below, lying down)
- Process:
  - Move shoulder blades together, slightly, to allow arm sockets to point slightly towards the ground
  - Move shoulders toward feet
  - Hands open, palms up
  - Feet open, away from each other
  - Head heavy against ground
  - Take several deep breaths; focus attention on sensation of breathing (at nostrils, or at abdomen)
  - Feel heaviness of the relaxing body:
    - Let go of tension in feet
    - Let go of tension in legs
    - Let go of tension in arms
    - Let go of tension in hands
    - Let go of tension in abdomen
    - Let go of tension in back
    - Let go of tension in chest
    - Let go of tension in shoulders
    - Let go of tension in neck
    - Let go of tension in skull
  - Focus attention on scalp, and regions of the scalp
  - Focus attention on face (forehead, temples, eyes, nose, cheeks, mouth, chin, jaw, ears)
  - Focus attention on back of head, and then neck, and throat
  - Focus attention on shoulders
  - Focus attention on arms (inside of upper arms, outside of upper arms, elbows, forearms, wrists, hands, each finger)
  - Focus attention on top of chest
  - Focus attention on ribs
  - Focus attention on shoulderblades
  - Focus attention on middle back
  - Focus attention on lower back
  - Focus attention on abdomen
  - Focus attention on hips
  - Focus attention on groin
  - Focus attention on legs (inner thighs, outer thighs, knees, shins, calves, ankles, heels, tops of feet, soles of feet, toes)
  - Focus attention on entire body: sensation of being alive, in this moment.
  - Slowly move fingers and toes, then arms and legs
  - Slowly open eyes, and slightly move rest of body
  - Roll over to one side; use arms and hands to move up to sitting position 

#### Lecture 9: Mind - Working with Thoughts
- Another component of mindfulness practice
- To manage thinking more consciously: strive not only 
  - To maintain awareness of thinking as it arises, but also
  - To identify the kinds of thoughts they are, then 
  - To make conscious choices about how to handle them.
- When you notice yourself thinking, consider whether it's:
  - rooted in selfishness/desires,
  - rooted in hatred/aversion, and/or
  - rooted in unrealistic beliefs about the world.
- To disarm a harmful thought:
  - Replacement (with a helpful corrolary thought) 
    - For desire, thoughts of the object-of-desire's impermanence; 
    - For animosity, thoughts of compassion for the object-of-dislike; 
    - For delusion, thoughts based in reality.
  - Reflecting on Results (contemplate the consequences of the harmful thought: even if it's simply "being a person whose mind frequently harbors and conjures such thoughts")
  - Reconstructing (examine the antecedents of the thought)
  - Redirecting (acknowledging that thoughts, like all else, pass away: then returning focus to e.g. the breath, or the elements of the body)

#### Lecture 10: Walking - Mindfulness While Moving
- Doesn't work well when walking to somewhere: best treated as an end, not a means
- Process:
  - Stand, chin level to the ground
  - Relax jaw; smile slightly
  - Briefly body-scan from feet to scalp, releasing tension
  - Before beginning, remind self of intention to be mindful during the practice (in fact, do this during sitting meditation, as well)
  - Hands can be clasped gently behind back, or left to slightly swing
  - Allow process of breath to fade into background
  - While walking:
    - At first: take each step mindfully; shift weight onto each new step mindfully
    - Later, once comfortable with "walking intentionally": attend to the changing sensations in the soles of your feet 
    - A third option: concentrate on the body as a unified, integrated, fluid organism
  - At end of path:
    - Come to complete stop
    - Brief body-scan, or simply enjoy pause and sensation of being/standing
  - Alternative: while walking, pause at each step; bring complete attention to that moment before taking the next step

#### Lecture 20: Anger - Cooling the Fires of Irritation
- First step: acknowledge anger
  - Learn to notice when you're feeling anger
  - Nonjudgmentally observe physical patterns (e.g. shallow breath, increased heartrate, tensed shoulder muscles)
- Second: accept anger
  - Don't try to distance yourself from the anger, or to suppress it (this, too, is a form of desire/attachment)
  - Allow, but don't exacerbate, it: consider, compassionately, that it may possibly indicate something relevant
- Third: act on anger
  - Mentally distinguish the feeling of the anger from the acting on the anger
  - Don't respond impulsively to the sensation of anger
  - Create space/time for reflection on the anger's sources; engage with those

#### Lecture 21: Pain - Embracing Physical Discomfort
- Awareness-of-pain meditation:
  - Eyes may be open or closed
  - Take several deep breaths
    - Bring awareness to sensation of breathing
    - Let body settle into state of deeper relaxation
    - Align focus on present moment
  - Let attention alight on area of body feeling most distress
    - Mentally locate the region
    - Let awareness slowly, cautiously approach the area
    - Purpose is simply to observe
      - Make no judgments about the pain
      - Harbor no intention to change it
    - Maintain a compassionate willingness to be present
  - Try to to define the (3d) region that feels painful (whether boundaries are defined or diffused)
  - Try to describe the quality of the pain: 
    - Sharp, dull 
    - Burning, freezing
    - Stinging, cramping, pounding, pulsing, 
    - Tight, clenching, sore, aching
  - Try to describe the dynamics of the pain: stationary, or moving? Fluctuating in intensity?
  - Try to observe your own awareness of the pain: try to become, not someone in pain, but an observer of someone in pain
