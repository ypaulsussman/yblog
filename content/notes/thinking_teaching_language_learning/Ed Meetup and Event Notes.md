### Educelerate, September 2018: Jobs to Be Done, Part 01

Be careful of the trap of using user/client/customer data that you already have. It's easy, because it's already there: but don't take for granted that it includes all the information you need (because it almost certainly does not.) Be sure to ask yourself: what data do we wish we had?

Remember the McDonald's research on milkshakes, and their greatest number of purchases occurring at 9am (because that is what parents used to preoccupy their children on the way to school or kindergarten) -- in that case it was competing not with juice, or soda: but with an iPad or a pacifier. Be sure that you know exactly what your product is competing with, because it may not be what you think.

**Job to Be Done:** what does the customer want to achieve?

- Functional aspects (_cost, timing, duration, location -- start with these, to quickly narrow down/focus options_)
- Emotional aspects (_subjective requirements -- harder to reason about quantitatively, but ultimately with a higher ROI for persuasion_)
  - Personal - how the customer feels
  - Social - how the customer thinks society sees it

Good phrasing to start from: “_I need ${x} so that${y}._”

Focus on one JTDB at a time.

One product may have different jobs for different users.

This framework may also be used to shape process/project flows (e.g. buyer funnels)

**Adult Ed User Persona** (_for JTBD, p2_ --> which you skipped b/c of work constraints)

- Age 35
- Works at distro center
- \$50k/yr
- FTE
- HSE
- Two kids < 7yrs
- “I need `${a new job}`, so that `${[I can get more money, my family sees me as more of a role model, I can keep my body from falling apart]}`.”
- “I need `${flexibility in when/where I study}` so that `${I don’t lose my current job while retraining}`.”

### Startup Week EdTech Founders' Panel, October 2017

Participants:
- IGDI lab (individual growth and development indicators)
  - U of M - proud history of general outcome measures
  - Early Learning Labs
- Urturn: gMaps of desired ed outcomes
  - "Mimicking mint.com, Fitbit"
  - 790 kids per counselor in MN (50th); national avg, 500
- Kidblog - online publishing for k-6
- Fanschool - fantasy sports for learning

Do your project/product for fun, then when it becomes overwhelming set up a company.
* "Small bets" -- first on your own, in your class; then using gsites for a few friends; then trial with [4.0 Schools](https://4pt0.org/) -- each time testing a (_progressively more important_) hypothesis
* Steve Blank: “_a startup is just discovery process for a business: once you have sustainable scalable model, then it's a business._” A startup is inherently temporary -- it's a search for a model, not an institution.

Selling to k-12 is hard; selling to teachers is hard; offering trainings is hard.
* License with channel partners (_established selling to schools_) if selling in the above spaces.
* If selling to a school? Max 2 or 3 year contract (so can re/negotiate).
* Public schools will buy in March-May; pay in June -- must prepare for this.
* Pricing: math must be easy for buyer
* Use competitive analysis to get at a pricing model.
* Follow the money -- e.g. the ESSA title 4 "family involvement" grant exists. Ask the school: how going to spend that fed cash? (_Answer, often: "we hadn't thought about it / we didn't even know we qualified..."_)
* Help school write grant in order to pay for your product. [Teaching Strategies LLC](https://teachingstrategies.com/contact/support/) provides grant application boilerplate on site for schools (!)

Large recent expansion in ECE financing, in order to improve achievement gap... big question on everyone's mind, currently: what to do with that money?

Lots of grant money out there, too -- ok to focus on those, not traditional startup funding sources. Example: SBIR (_small business innovation research_) grants are underrated: follow ‘em.

Cherish opportunities to learn about business: it’s none of our backgrounds. Learn to write a business plan -- participate in MNCup b/c it forces you to write one

[Traction](https://www.cmiteamwork.com/documents/BookReport-Traction.pdf) -- the book to read; recommended by literally 3 out of 4 participants as “maybe most important book” -- crucial for maximizing meetings.

Take lessons from [Amazon Inspire](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2017-06-26-what-happened-to-amazon-inspire-the-tech-giant-s-education-marketplace), too (_OK, but... which?_)
