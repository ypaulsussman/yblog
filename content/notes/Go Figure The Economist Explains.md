That's when the two most popular blogs on The Economist's website - the Economist Explains and the Daily Chart - provide answers to the questions, quirky and serious, that puzzle anyone interested in the world around them.\")"

Modern cells rely on...

1.  long strands of **DNA** to encode their genetic information,
2.  shorter strands of **RNA** to carry that information around; and
3.  **proteins** (made using that information) to run the chemical reactions they require to live.

RNA is able to carry out the functions of the two others, and may thus predate them.

Almost all cells possess a structure called a **ribosome**, a molecular factory that strings proteins together from chemicals called **amino acids**. The structure of something so vital is likely to have been conserved, even over billions of years. And the business end of a ribosome, the part that actually does the assembling, is a single long strand of RNA.

Signals sent over **voice-centric 2G networks** generally propagate further and provide better in-building coverage than those of **data-centric 3G networks**.

That is because 2G signals typically use the 900MHz and 1800MHz frequency bands, whereas in most countries 3G signals are generally sent in the 2100MHz band. Signals sent at higher frequencies don’t travel so far or penetrate walls so well.

In many countries, the low-frequency 2G spectrum is being “refarmed” (ie, repurposed) for 3G, which allows 3G signals to travel further.

Newer 4G networks operate in a range of frequency bands, using 700MHz and 800MHz signals in many countries to provide wider coverage. (_That also helps explain why you can get 4G in places where you couldn’t get 3G._)

**Advertisers know the cookie IDs of users** who have come to their website, or can buy that information from another firm, and then advertise only to those users. 

Increasingly this is done via an automated auction process, called **“real-time bidding”**. 

1. The website where an advertising slot needs filling sends [_information about the user and the page where the ad would run_] to an online advertising exchange, where 
2. advertisers decide whether they want to bid on that particular slot, usually 
3. offering more if it is a user who has shown interest in their product in the past. 
    
The entire process happens in a fraction of a second; and that is how ads appear to read your mind, and follow you around the web.

Humans have **stereoscopic vision**, which means that they perceive depth by noting the subtle differences between the images received by each of their eyes. 

**VR headsets have two tiny screens**, one for each eye, which exploit that. By carefully altering the images fed to each eye, the user’s brain is persuaded that it is looking at an entire three-dimensional world instead of a pair of flat images.

Modern VR headsets are fitted with tiny sensors similar to those used in smartphones – accelerometers, gyroscopes and the like – which can keep track of the movements of the wearer’s head. When the user looks around, the computer can then update the view on the screens.

For VR to work, the illusion must be extraordinarily slick. Humans are extremely sensitive to visual inconsistencies; even small snags can cause “VR sickness”, an affliction like motion-sickness. So images must update very quickly. That requires beefy computing hardware capable of generating 90 or more frames of animation a second.

And the sensors that track the user’s head must be able to talk to the computer at least that fast: any delay can cause an unpleasant dragging sensation.

The **sky appears blue** because shorter wavelengths are scattered more by the atmosphere than longer wavelengths; so the scattered sunlight that reaches our eyes when looking at the sky (rather than at the sun itself) is predominantly blue.

This phenomenon (_Rayleigh scattering_) is named after Lord Rayleigh, the British physicist who discovered it in the 19th century.

Space, particularly in the vicinity of stars and planets, is empty only by comparison with planetary surfaces.

- It has **[solar] wind**, in the form of the zillions of charged particles streaming from the sun.
- It has storms, in the shape of
  - **solar flares**, enormous eruptions of plasma that spew charged particles out into space, and
  - **coronal mass ejections**, which blast a quantity of the sun’s mass out into the solar system.

In 1989 a **geomagnetic storm** (_a disturbance in the Earth’s magnetic field caused by a coronal mass ejection_) induced big electrical currents in Quebec’s electricity grid, cutting power to millions of people for nine hours.

Why was **Pluto demoted from the planetary club**? The immediate reason was that Pluto did not meet the definition of a planet that was formally agreed, for the first time, at the 2006 IAU meeting. 

To qualify as a planet, the astronomers decided, an object must:
1. be in orbit around the sun (_so, for instance, Earth’s moon does not count, despite being considerably bigger than Pluto_).
2. It must be massive enough to have become spherical under the force of its own gravity (_which rules out things like asteroids and comets_).
3. And finally, it must have “cleared its orbit”, either by absorbing other nearby objects into itself, or by kicking them out of the way with its gravity.

That definition attempts to capture the intuition that planets should be the most notable features of solar systems after their stars. Pluto passes the first two tests, but fails the third.

Pluto is merely one among thousands of “trans-Neptunian objects” (TNOs), itinerant hunks of rock and ice that drift around in the distant reaches of the solar system.

In 2005 a team led by Mike Brown, an astronomer at the California Institute of Technology, announced the discovery of Eris, another big TNO. Eris is almost as large as Pluto (with a diameter of 1,163km, compared with 1,184km for Pluto) and is about 25% more massive.

When Ceres, the most massive of the asteroids (and now another member of the club of dwarf planets), was discovered, in 1801, it too was designated a full-blown planet. Only later, as it became clear that it was merely the largest constituent of a vast, messy disk of rocks orbiting between Mars and Jupiter – what is today called the asteroid belt – was its planetary status rescinded.

**Comets**... formed billions of years ago around the far fringes of the solar system, and consist of lumps of ice mixed with rock, dust and frozen gases. As a comet’s orbit brings it closer to the sun, it heats up and grows a “tail” of water and dust.

**Asteroids**, by contrast, formed closer to the sun: they are leftovers from the era of planetary formation, and are mostly found within the orbit of Jupiter. Rocky in nature, they are also sometimes called _planetoids_ or _minor planets_.

Asteroids smaller than a few metres across are known as **meteoroids**, as are the small pieces of dust, rock and ice shed by comets.

The skies high above the Earth are cluttered up with around 23,000 pieces of **man-made space junk** measuring 10cm or more across, zipping along at great speed and posing a threat to working satellites.

Every such collision spawns more junk – a phenomenon known as the **Kessler syndrome**, named after Donald Kessler, an American physicist who postulated it in the 1970s.

**Low-Earth orbit**, the region between 160 and 2,000km above the Earth, is crucial to space exploration. It is home to about half of the roughly 1,300 satellites which scan the Earth in great detail for both military and civilian purposes. It is also littered with “around 5,000 objects that are either rocket bodies or dead payloads,” says Kessler.

Dead satellites located in **geosynchronous orbit** (about 36,000km above the surface of the Earth) are sometimes pushed into a **“graveyard orbit”** about 300km further out.

Scientists in Japan have recommended installing lasers on the International Space Station to nudge debris into the Earth’s atmosphere, where it would burn up harmlessly.

Of the 22,000 catalogued pieces of orbital junk known in 2012, only 16,000 have a known launching nation-state.

Kessler estimates that removing the 500 most dangerous objects, even at the slow rate of five a year, would solve most of the problem at a modest cost. The technology exists to do it; the obstacles are chiefly regulatory.

A war that broke out ...in 1754, and carried on until 1763. Fighting did not start in Europe until 1756, which is why the conflict is known as the **Seven Years’ War** in that part of the world. But it was **[the first war that was] truly global**. Every inhabited continent except Australia saw fighting on its soil, and independent powers on three of those continents were active participants.

On May 28th 1754, a small group of soldiers from the British colony of Virginia, under the command of George Washington, engaged a group of French troops who were interloping... Instead of peacefully repelling them as he had been instructed, Washington ended up killing several of them, including their commanding officer. 

The conflict in North America then continued, with both sides fighting in alliance with local native American nations.

Two years later, Britain’s ally Prussia attacked the small German state of Saxony, bringing Saxony’s ally Austria, and thus Austria’s ally France (and therefore France’s enemy and Prussia’s ally, Britain), into the conflict on European soil.

Both Britain and France reinforced their colonial troops in North America, and started attacking each other’s colonies in the West Indies and trading stations in Africa and India. In India, some of the princely states which had recently emerged from the dying Mughal empire also got involved, and Britain ended up taking over one of them, Bengal.

The war came to South America when, near its end, Spain joined the French side and attacked one of the American colonies of Britain’s ally, Portugal.

...it is **the reason why the modern world is an English-speaking one.** As a colonial power, France was destroyed, and did not return seriously to the business of overseas conquest until it attacked Algeria in 1830.

All of North America east of the Mississippi became British, save the city of New Orleans, which became Spanish. And the foundations of British rule in India were laid as well.

Arthur **Guinness**, who founded a brewery in Dublin in 1759, might have been surprised that his drink would one day become such a potent national symbol.  He was a committed unionist and opponent of Irish nationalism... 
* before the Irish Rebellion of 1798 he was even accused of spying for the British authorities.
* The company was alleged to have lent men and equipment to the British army to help crush Irish rebels during the Easter Rising of 1916, 
* afterwards [it fired] members of staff whom it believed to have Irish-nationalist sympathies. 
* The beer the company has become most famous for – porter stout – was based on a London ale, a favourite of the street porters of Covent Garden...
