description: "I'd heard lots of (potentially unfair) things about business and management books, so I wanted to read several. But not actually commit any serious time to doing so. Fortunately, this (largely executive-catering) genre featured plenty of bullet-point summaries for me to... well, condense into smaller summaries."

### Leadership and Self-Deception

- Think back to when you first joined an organization.
  - You were happy and focused on results that would help the organization succeed. Your “what focus” was the results and the “who focus” was the organization.
  - Over time, however, many people become unhappy with the organization and/or the people they work with, and their focus shifts from results to themselves.
- We fail to focus on results because we are focusing on making ourselves look good at the expense of others.
- When we are self-deceived, we
  1. inflate others' faults,
  2. inflate our own virtue,
  3. inflate the value of things that justify our self-betrayal, and
  4. blame others.
- Focus on your employees’ cares, fears, hopes and needs - their aspirations, desires, frustrations and general humanity.

### The Hard Thing about Hard Things

- Spend zero time on what you _could_ have done; concentrate all of your efforts on finding that one seemingly impossible way out of your current mess.
- Hire for strengths versus lack of weakness.
- At every single point of your venture’s life, invest in training your team.
- Make sure you are a great place to work.

- Build a trusted circle of friends where you can be open about your thoughts. (_They will help you think through challenging situations and provide strength._)
- Clear your mind. (_Get your thoughts out of your head and onto paper, in order to see them and get some perspective on the situation._)
- Free up your emotional bandwidth. (_Dwelling on the past and worrying about the future eat up your emotional resources... focus on where you are going rather than on what you hope to avoid._)

### One-Minute Manager

- A goal, and its performance standard, should take no more than 250 words to express.... anyone be able to read it within a minute.
- 80% of your really important results will come from 20% of your goals: only do Goal Setting on that 20%—maybe three to six goals.
- “If you can’t tell me what you’d _like_ to be happening, you don’t have a problem yet. You’re just complaining. A problem only exists if there is a difference between what is _actually_ happening and what you _desire_ to be happening."

**One-Minute Praising** works well when you:

1.  Tell people up front that you are going to let them know how they are doing.
2.  Praise people immediately.
3.  Tell people what they did right—be specific.
4.  Tell people how good you feel about what they did right, and how it helps the organization and the other people who work there.
5.  Stop for a moment of silence to let them “feel” how good you feel.
6.  Encourage them to do more of the same.
7.  Shake hands or touch people in a way that makes it clear that you support their success in the organization.

**One-Minute Reprimands** works well when you:

1.  Tell people beforehand that you are going to let them know how they are doing and in no uncertain terms.
2.  Reprimand people immediately.
3.  Tell people what they did wrong—be specific.
4.  Tell people how you feel about what they did wrong—and in no uncertain terms.
5.  Stop for a few seconds of uncomfortable silence to let them feel how you feel.
6.  Shake hands, or touch them in a way that lets them know you are honestly on their side.
7.  Reaffirm that you think well of them but not of their performance in this situation.
8.  Remind them how much you value them.
9.  Acknowledge that when the reprimand is over, it’s over.

“Most companies spend 50% to 70% of their money on people’s salaries. And yet they spend less than 1% of their budget to train their people. Most companies, in fact, spend more time and money on maintaining their buildings and equipment than they do on maintaining and developing people."

### Good to Great

- Leaders embody a paradoxical mix of personal humility and professional will.
    - Lead with questions, not answers.
    - Engage in dialogue and debate, not coercion.
    - Conduct autopsies, without blame.
    - Build “red flag” mechanisms that turn “information” into “information that cannot be ignored.”

- You can’t achieve great things without great people.
    - Don’t create a strategy, then try to rally people around it; instead, start with great people and build great results from their efforts.
    - When in doubt, don’t hire — keep looking.
    - When you know you need to make a personnel change, act. The moment you feel the need to tightly manage (not guide, teach, or lead, but tightly manage) someone, you’ve made a hiring mistake.
    - Put your best people on your biggest opportunities, not your biggest problems.

- Simplicity rules. Know “the Hedgehog Concept,” i.e.,
    - what  your organizations are passionate about,
    - what denominator drives their economic engine, and
    - what they can (and cannot) be the best at in the world.

- Enterprise-wide discipline is essential. When you combine a culture of discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship, you are more likely to achieve great results.
    - Build a culture around the idea of “freedom and responsibility within a clear framework.”
    - Manage the framework/system, not the people.
    - Maintain focus (with almost religious consistency) on the Hedgehog Concept. If it does not relate to one of the three questions, don’t bother with it.

- Technology is firstly and foremostly an accelerator: and only that. Do not jump on technological bandwagons or chase after fads: instead, determine what technology makes the most sense for a given need, then pioneer its application.

### The Innovator’s Dilemma

External forces (customers) control decision-making far more than executives. Managers proposing new disruptive technology can

1.  Try to convince the company, or
2.  Create an independent organization.

Option (2) works best, b/c “What customers will we serve? What business model will we follow?” cannot have different answers within the same company.

As products change, the metric changes. Customers move from one step the next based on oversupply:
- functionality (possibly along multiple functions),
- reliability,
- convenience, and
- price.

(e.g. for disk drives this was first capacity, then size, then reliability, then cost.)

Disruptive technologies are simpler, cheaper, more reliable and more convenient than established technologies.

The Dilemmas of Innovation
- Market progress is separate from technology progress. Customers do not always know what they need.
- Disruptive technology needs a new market. Old customers are less relevant. Disruptive technology is a marketing problem, not a technological one.
- Organizations have narrow capabilities. New markets enabled by disruptive technologies require very different capabilities.
- Information required to make investment decisions does not exist. Failure and iterative learning are required.
- Small entrant firms enjoy protection because they are doing things that do not make sense to the industry leaders.

### The Innovator’s Solution

Ten questions in building new growth businesses:
1.  How can we beat the competition?
2.  Which customers should we target?
3.  What products will our customers want to buy?
4.  How should we distribute to and communicate with our customers?
5.  Which things should our company do, and which should our partners and suppliers do?
6.  How can we avoid commoditization?
7.  Who should be on our management team?
8.  What is the best organizational structure for this business?
9.  How can we know when to change course?
10. Whose investment capital will help, and whose might hurt?

Checklist to establish what an organization is capable and incapable of accomplishing:

1. Resources
    - People
    - Technology
    - Products
    - Equipment
    - Information
    - Cash
    - Brand
    - Distribution
2. Processes
    - Hiring & Training
    - Product development
    - Manufacturing
    - Planning & Budgeting
    - Market Research
    - Resource allocation
3. Values (_i.e., the criteria by which prioritization decisions are made_)
    - Ethics
    - Cost structure, income statement
    - Size of opportunity

Searching for de-commoditization:
- Many executives are resigned to the belief that, regardless of the innovation, the inevitable fate of their products is to be “commoditized.”
- But: whenever commoditization is underway at one point in a value chain, a reciprocal process—call it “de-commoditization”—is at work somewhere else in the same chain.
- Whereas commoditization’s lack of product differentiability undermines an organization’s ability to capture profits, “de-commoditization” creates opportunities to create and capture significant wealth.
- This de-commoditization occurs in places in the value chain where attractive profits were hard to maintain in the past: in the formerly modular and non-differentiable processes, components, or subsystems.
- The companies that position themselves at these spots will capture the profit.

New-market disruption has four components:
- The target customers are trying to get a job done, but a simple, inexpensive solution has been beyond reach.
- These customers will compare the disruptive product to having nothing at all. As a result, they are delighted to buy it, even though it may not be as good as other products (those available to current users in the original value network.)
- The technology that enables the disruption might be quite sophisticated, but the purchaseand use of the product are forced to be simple, convenient, and foolproof.
- The disruptive innovation creates an entirely new value network: the new consumers typically purchase the product through new channels, and use it in new venues.

### High-Output Management
- Does that mean that you shouldn't plan? Not at all. You need to plan the way a fire department plans. It cannot anticipate fires, so it has to shape a flexible organization that is capable of responding to unpredictable events.
- ...try not to get too depressed in... the journey, because there’s a professional responsibility. If you are depressed, you can’t motivate your staff... So you have to keep your own spirits up even though you well understand that you don’t know what you’re doing.
- Just as you would not permit a fellow employee to steal a piece of office equipment worth \$2,000, you shouldn't let anyone walk away with the time of his fellow managers.
- Success breeds complacency. Complacency breeds failure. Only the paranoid survive.
- ...\[ask lots of questions, in order to\] detect and fix any problem at the lowest-value stage possible.
- Measurement against a standard makes you think through why the results were what they were.
