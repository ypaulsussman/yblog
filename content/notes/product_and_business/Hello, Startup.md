## Hello, Startup (Brikman, Yevgeniy)

- try to become a T-shaped person: people who are both 
    - generalists (highly skilled at a broad set of valuable things — the top of the T) and also 
        - To be a generalist, you have to regularly seek out new ideas.
        - One way to do this is to come up with top five lists.
            - For example, you could make a list of all literary genres (e.g., history, psychology, science fiction, math, computer science, biology, etc.) and try to read the five most famous books from each one, or make a list of all school subjects (e.g., math, physics, history, biology, English, etc.) and either try to take a class on the top five topics from each one, or for the ones you don’t have time to take, try to read the best textbook on the topic instead.2 for a list of resources that help you get started with “top five” lists.]
            - time I’ve done something like this, I’ve always been struck by how much overlap there is between seemingly unrelated areas of human knowledge.
            - The reason for all of this overlap is because most books, movies, and classes are actually about people. Programming books are not about code but about how to write code that people can understand.
            - horror movies are not about technology or aliens or monsters but about what people may have to do to survive when faced with unusual circumstances. And because all of this knowledge is fundamentally about people, the same core principles come up again and again in many different forms, and therefore, those principles are useful in almost any discipline.
    - experts (among the best in their field within a narrow discipline — the vertical leg of the T).
        - To become an expert, you have to be intensely, almost obsessively curious about a specific topic.
        - You need to develop enough expertise to get to the cutting edge of your chosen discipline.
            - Alan Kay described how they “lived in the future” at Xerox PARC
            - the researchers played a game that later became known as the Wayne Gretzky Game, named after the greatest hockey player of all time, who attributed much of his success to a simple strategy: “skate to where the puck is going, not where it’s been.” The idea behind the Wayne Gretzky Game is similar: you want to put the puck way out there, perhaps 30 years or more, so far out that you don’t have to worry about how you will get there. You ask yourself a question along the lines of “wouldn’t it be ridiculous if, in 30 years, we didn’t have…?”

- Another way to add constraints is to go in the other direction: look for new enabling technologies that are just starting to appear on the market and try to find a gap between how things have been done and how they can be done now that these technologies are available [Levie 2014b
- Perhaps the easiest way to add constraints is to look for something wrong or painful. Looking for pain points is such a powerful technique that it merits a more detailed look.

- Any time you hear yourself saying the phrase “this is stupid, there has to be a better way” [Al-Qudsi 2011], write it down. In other words, use your idea journal not only for remembering solutions, but also for remembering problems.

---

- Talking about your ideas, questions, or pain points with other people is a powerful tool for creativity. Much like writing your thoughts down, presenting them verbally so another person can understand them helps you understand them better yourself, and sometimes leads to new ideas.

- If you’re worried that someone is going to steal your idea and beat you just from overhearing your idea, then that idea probably wasn’t defensible to begin with. By defensible, I mean that a good business idea should include some sort of differentiators that put a huge distance between you and the competition

- there are a few places where speed does not win. Any time you’re dealing with legal concerns, security, privacy, or money, take your time and err on the side of “measure twice, cut once.”

- Here’s the fundamental idea behind Boyd’s Law, "speed wins", Agile, and Lean: some of your assumptions are wrong. The problem is, you don’t know which ones.
    - You might be building the wrong thing, marketing it to the wrong audience, or have the wrong business model.
    - A study by CB Insights of over 100 startup postmortems showed that the number-one reason for startup failure, by a large margin, was “no market need”

- Although it’s tempting to spend all your time on product and technology, especially if you’re a programmer, the only way to be sure that your efforts are not in vain is to spend some time with customers.
    - The sooner you start validating your ideas with people who are not your coworkers, the better your chances of success.

---

- three sequential stages:
    - Step 1: Validate the problem Make sure you’ve identified a problem that customers actually have and that the problem is painful enough that they are willing to pay to solve it. 
    - Step 2: Validate the MVP Build a minimum viable product (MVP) of a potential solution and validate it by getting a small number of customers to buy it. 
    - Step 3: Validate the product Grow the MVP into a full product and validate that you have a scalable business by getting a much larger number of customers to buy it.

- Note that you might have to repeat each of these steps multiple times or even go back to previous steps. 
    - For example, it might take you many tries to find a real problem.
    - Once you’ve found one, it might take you many more tries to build a prototype that customers are willing to buy. 
    - Sometimes none of the prototypes will work and you’ll have to find a new problem to solve. 
    - Similarly, you might have to try many things to scale your prototype into a product, and occasionally you’ll find that your prototype works but the business model doesn’t scale, and you’ll have to go back to a previous step.

- There are three aspects to consider when thinking about the size of a problem: 
    - Frequency: Does the problem you’re solving occur often? 
    - Density: Do a lot of people face this problem? 
    - Pain: Is the problem just an annoyance, or something you absolutely must resolve?

- different ways to estimate the size of the market

- Many advertising companies offer ad-targeting tools that you can use to research the market without actually paying for any ads

- If there are already companies solving this problem, it’s not necessarily a bad thing. If anything, the fact that your idea isn’t unique is validation that you’ve found a real problem.

- To see how a specific competitor is doing, you can try website analytics tools (e.g., comScore, Quantcast) and mobile analytics tools (e.g., App Annie, Xyo) to estimate their traffic.

- Another good way to validate problems is to see if there is already a community of people talking about them. You can search for meetups, conferences, user groups, and online forums to estimate how many people this problem affects.

- Search online for newspapers, books, journals, classes, podcasts, and blogs that discuss your topic. When relevant, you can also look up SEC filings and government reports (e.g., from the US Small Business Administration).

- When you talk to customers, your goal is to learn everything you can about their day-to-day lives and determine the following: Is this a real problem for the customer? What possible solutions are there to the problem? How much is the customer willing to pay to solve the problem? To

- most of the time they still won’t be able to help you find a good solution, as customers usually only think in terms of 10% better, faster, and cheaper

- Many customers will ask you for specific features, but your goal is not to walk away with a long feature list. Small incremental improvements and slightly better features rarely make for good startup ideas,

- so your real goal is to get a deep understanding of the underlying problem.

- Don’t push your ideas on the customer or try to convince them. Instead, try to get them to do as much of the talking as possible. A classic technique you can use, pioneered by Toyota founder Sakichi Toyoda, is the five whys.

- After a number of customer conversations, you should have a better understanding of what the real problems are. 

--- 

- Before jumping in and building a solution, there is one final quality you must check for: feasibility.

- There are two facets to whether a problem is feasible: 
    - The problem can be solved. 
    - The problem can be solved by you.

- The partners at Sequoia Capital, one of the most successful venture capital firms in the world, ask founders the following question: “Why now?”

- As far as the customer is concerned, the interface is the product. [Raskin 2000, 5], Jeff Raskin,

- five principles of user-centered design that you should incorporate into your product development process: 
    - User stories 
        - before you dive into the code, you should be able to define a user story. A user story is a short description of what you’re building from the perspective of the user. It should answer three questions: Who is the user? What are they trying to accomplish? Why do they need it?
        - as Steve Krug said, “the main thing you need to know about instructions is that no one is going to read them”
        - most common design mistakes is to confuse a user’s goals (what they want to accomplish) with tasks (how they can accomplish it).
        - Alan Cooper’s advice from The Inmates Are Running the Asylum: There is an easy way to tell the difference between tasks and goals. Tasks change as technology changes, but goals have the pleasant property of remaining very stable. For example, to travel from St. Louis to San Francisco, my goals are speed, comfort, and safety.
        - Heading for the California gold fields in 1850, I would have made the journey in my new, high-tech Conestoga wagon. In the interest of safety, I would have brought my Winchester rifle. Heading from St. Louis to the Silicon Valley in 1999, I would make the journey in a new, high-tech Boeing 777.
        - The point of the third question, “Why do they need it?”, is to force you to justify why you’re building what you’re building.
        - If this product or feature isn’t solving an important problem for a real user, you shouldn’t be wasting your time building it.
    - Personas 
        - stop designing products for the “average person.”
        - A better idea is to design for personas. A persona is a fictional character that represents a real user of your product who has specific goals, traits, and desires.
        - Each persona should include a name, age, short bio, work history, and a set of skills, beliefs, goals, and any other details relevant to your business.
        - Once you have defined personas for your product, never mention the “average user” again,
        - only discuss whether your personas would want X or Y.
        - Personas should be based on your market research and customer interviews (see “Validation”). Your goal is to identify a small number (typically 1–3) of primary personas whose goals must be fulfilled or else the entire product is a failure.
        - Your goal is to make these primary personas as happy as possible by figuring out their goals and building a product that is exceptional at helping them achieve those goals, and nothing else
    - Emotional design 
        - Studies have shown that people interact with computers and software much like they would with another human. Most people act politely toward computers, though occasionally things get hostile;
        - they react differently to computers with female voices than those with male voices; and in the right scenario, people think of computers as team members or even friends
        - every piece of software makes you feel something. Most of your emotional reactions are automatic and the parts of the brain that control them have not evolved enough to distinguish between a real person and an inanimate object that acts like a person.
        - Think of your product as a person. What type of person do you want it to be? Polite? Stern? Forgiving? Strict? Funny? Deadpan? Serious? Loose? Do you want to come off as paranoid or trusting? As a know-it-all? Or modest and likable? Once you decide, always keep those personality traits in mind as the product is built. Use them to guide the copywriting, the interface, and the feature set. Whenever you make a change, ask yourself if that change fits your app’s personality. Your product has a voice — and it’s talking to your customers 24 hours a day. [Fried, Hansson, and Linderman 2006, 123], Jason Fried, David Heinemeier Hansson, and Matthew Linderman, Getting Real
        - Whenever possible, try to design software that acts like a considerate human being who remembers you. Remember the user’s preferences, what they were doing the last time they were using your software, and what they’ve searched for in the past, and try to use this information to predict what they will want to do in the future.
        - If you recently changed your password and you try to log in with the old one by accident, instead of the standard “invalid password” error message, Google shows you a reminder that “your password was changed 12 days ago.”
        - A good design is responsive to the user’s needs.
        - One of the simplest design elements that is often overlooked is providing basic feedback. Did the user click a button? Show them an indication to confirm the click, such as changing the button appearance or making a sound. Will it take time to process the click? Show an indication that there is work going on in the background, such as a progress bar or an interstitial.
        - Human beings make mistakes. Constantly. Design your software to assume that the user will make a typo, click the wrong button, or forget some critical information.
        - Eliminate the term human error. Instead, talk about communication and interaction: what we call an error is usually bad communication or interaction.
        - Why can’t the interaction between a person and a machine be thought of as collaboration? [Norman 2013, 67], Don Norman, The Design of Everday Things
        - Instead of error messages, provide help and guidance [Norman 2013, 65]. For example, avoid words like “Error,” “Failed,” “Problem,” “Invalid,” and “Wrong.” Instead, explain what kind of input you’re looking for and how the user’s input differs. Check the user’s input while the user is typing (not after a page submission) and show feedback, both positive and negative, right next to where the user is looking (not at the top of the page). Never lose the user’s work.
        - In addition to showing helpful messages, you should try to create a design that prevents mistakes in the first place. In Lean manufacturing, this is called a poka-yoke, which is a Japanese term for “mistake-proofing.” For instance, when you’re typing
        - a new question into Stack Overflow, it automatically searches for similar questions to discourage you from submitting duplicates and automatically warns you if your question is likely to be closed for being subjective (e.g., “what is the best X?”),
        - This is the key to using contrast effectively: if two items on a page are not the same, make them very different
    - Simplicity 
        - Most programmers love deleting code, especially as the result of finding a more concise solution to a problem. This usually requires that you understand the problem at a deeper level so that you can come up with an implementation that is more elegant. The same is true of design. You should enjoy the process of removing features and chopping out parts of a design, especially as the result of finding a more elegant solution.
    - Usability testing
        - Don’t confuse usability testing with focus groups. The goal of a focus group is to see how people feel about an idea or a product. The goal of usability testing is to see how people use your actual product to accomplish specific tasks.

- Remember, a product is not just one idea but a constant cycle of new problems, new ideas, and execution. Execution is expensive, so you need to validate each new problem and idea as quickly and cheaply as possible with customers. The best way to do that is to build what’s known as a minimum viable product, or MVP.

- The Lean Startup, which has a proper definition: an MVP is “a version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort”

- The point of an MVP is learning. The goal is to find the cheapest way to validate a hypothesis with real customers.

- The “minimum” in MVP means eliminating anything that does not directly help you validate the current hypothesis.

- you will most likely have to build multiple MVPs before you find one that works. But even more importantly, building MVPs is more of a way of thinking than just an activity you do early in the life cycle of a product. Think of it like placing little bets instead of betting the house every time you play a game of cards.

- use the MVP mindset, which can be summarized as: Identify your riskiest, most central assumption. Phrase the assumption as a testable hypothesis. Build the smallest experiment (an MVP) that tests your hypothesis. Analyze the results. Repeat step 1 with your new findings.

- No matter how confident you are in an idea, always try to find the smallest and cheapest way to test it, and always try to keep projects small and incremental.

- the secret to project success is to strongly recommend and enforce limits on size and complexity.

- the most common types of MVPs: 
    - Landing page
        - An easy, cheap, and surprisingly effective MVP is a simple web page that describes your product and asks the user for some sort of commitment if they are interested, such as providing their email address to get more info or placing a pre-order. 
        - The general idea is to describe the most ideal vision of your product and see how much traction you can get, even if the product does not yet exist.
    - Explainer video
        - Before Drew Houston started building DropBox, he wanted to be sure he wasn’t spending years building a product nobody wanted.
        - Instead, Houston built a much simpler MVP: a landing page with a sign-up form, plus a four-minute explainer video
        - The video was an effective way to show the product in action rather than just describe
    - Crowdfunding sites such as Kickstarter or Indiegogo 
        - a bit like a landing page with an explainer video, except instead of email addresses, interested customers give you money to support your project. 
        - In other words, this is a way to get customers to buy your product before you build it, which is the best validation you can get.
    - Wizard of Oz 
        - A Wizard of Oz MVP is one that looks like a real product to a user but behind the scenes, the founders are doing everything manually.
    - Piecemeal MVP 
        - A piecemeal MVP is similar to the Wizard of Oz MVP, except some of the manual pieces are automated as cheaply as possible with existing, off-the-shelf tools.
        - For example, to create the Groupon MVP, Andrew Mason put a custom skin on a WordPress Blog (see Figure 3-40), used FileMaker to generate coupon PDFs, and sent them out using Apple Mail

--- 
- Whatever type of MVP you end up building, the key is to ensure that you build something that is minimal but still viable. And the best way to do that is to focus on your differentiators.

- method of questioning can make people uncomfortable, it’s something we should all apply to our lives. What’s important in your field? What are you working on? Why aren’t those one and the same?

- The same reasoning applies to building an MVP. What is important in your product? What are you actually building in the MVP? Why aren’t those one and the same? The most important aspect of a product is its differentiators: those features that separate it from all the other alternatives. People often refer to differentiators as the “competitive advantage,” but that phrase makes it seem like any advantage, no matter how marginal, is enough. It’s not. Your differentiators need to be much, much better than the competition. You’re looking not for a 10% improvement, but a 10x improvement. Anything less, and most customers simply won’t think it’s worth the effort to switch.

- Therefore, it’s important to ask yourself, “what two or three things does my product do exceptionally well?”

- Once you identify this small number of core features, build your MVP around them and ignore just about everything else.

- It’s much easier to take a product that a small number of users love and get a lot more users to love it than it is to take a product that a large number of users like and get them to love it

---

- How do you know which features to focus on? One way to figure it out is to write a blog post announcing the product launch before you build anything. What are the two or three key items you’re going to highlight in that blog post? What features will you show off in the screenshots? What will be the title of the blog post? Good blog posts are short, so this exercise will help you tease out what features really matter

- Every extra feature has a significant cost (see “Simplicity”), so unless it’s absolutely essential for delighting customers or validating your hypothesis, it doesn’t belong in the MVP.

---

- Your goal in the early days of a startup, when you’re still validating the problem and solution, is to find the right early adopters. These are the kinds of customers who will commit to buying your solution long before it’s ready because they believe in your vision rather than the specific product. Steve Blank calls this group of customers earlyvangelists and provides the following handy list to help identify them: They have a problem or need. They understand they have a problem. They’re actively searching for a solution and have a timetable for finding it. The problem is so painful that they’ve cobbled together an interim solution. They’ve committed, or can quickly acquire, budget dollars to purchase.

- If you can find a customer who has already hacked together their own interim solution, that may be the best indicator of all because then you know you’ve found a real problem and a strong lead. Every industry has earlyvangelists, though there usually aren’t that many. That said, at this early stage, when you have no product and no customers, getting even a single customer is a huge win.

- One of the most common pieces of advice Y Combinator gives to startups is to “do things that don’t scale.” That is, in the early days of a startup, you might have to do many things manually, such as hiring, recruiting users, and customer service. This will feel inefficient, especially to programmers, who will be tempted to yell “But that won’t scale!” But manual labor is often the only way to get the fly wheel started, and only once it’s really going do you need to worry about scaling.

- The best thing you can do is to start reusing existing designs, writing user stories, and designing for personas. With practice, you can learn copywriting, layout, typography, contrast, repetition, and colors. By giving your product a personality, especially a polite one that is responsive, considerate, and forgiving, you can build a design that resonates emotionally. And by frequently running usability tests, you can get direct feedback on how you’re progressing.

- the best strategy is to constantly be running small experiments and adjusting them based on feedback from real users. Do a little market research, talk to potential customers, release a quick MVP, learn from your users’ reactions, and then repeat again and again.

---

- You don’t have to measure everything to get value out of measuring. In fact, you usually get the most bang for the buck off of the initial few measurements, and then diminishing returns with more and more elaborate methods.

- For each type of data X, ask yourself two questions: 
    - If I could measure X, is there at least one concrete decision it would affect? 
    - Is that decision worth more than the cost to measure X?
- If you can’t answer “yes” to both questions, then it’s not worth measuring X.

- The numbers that matter to a startup will vary from company to company, but there are several types of metrics that just about everyone will need to track: 
    - Acquisition 
        - how users find your product.
        - use distribution channels such as search engines, advertising, blogs, email, TV, and social networks. Because acquisition is the top of the funnel, it’s the first and often the toughest bottleneck for growth.
    - Activation 
        -a measure of how many users engage with your product by signing up for an account, inviting a friend, performing a search, or making a purchase.
        - If you have the wrong messaging, your design doesn’t make it obvious what the user needs to do, or if your acquisition channel is bringing in the wrong audience, the user might bounce, or leave the product immediately after seeing it, without performing any actions.
        - This is one area where you can do heavy A/B testing
        - break down the activation numbers by acquisition channel to see if certain channels are leading to higher activation rates than others.
    - Retention 
        - The next stage is getting activated users to come back and use your product again. In some ways, this is also acquisition, but retention typically uses different channels and therefore should be tracked separately. Most users have lots of things fighting for their attention, so they will not remember to keep using your app or come back to your website unless you go out of your way to remind them.
        - Even users that have activated still need to see a product many times before it sticks and becomes a part of their routine. You’ll want to track how many of your visitors return after a week, a month, and a year. And just as some of your acquisition channels will work better than others, you’ll want to track which of your retention channels is most effective at getting users to come back. Finally, make sure to break the retention numbers down across activation and acquisition dimensions.
    - Referral 
        - In a sense, this is also another form of acquisition, but one that’s focused on one specific channel: existing users of your product helping you acquire new users. It’s worth calling out separately because just about every product in the world, no matter what other distribution channels it uses, still relies heavily on word of mouth
    - Revenue 
        - tracking how much money you’re making and what channels it’s coming through, such as sales, subscriptions, ads, or biz dev. You will probably want to use your revenue numbers to calculate the customer lifetime value (CLV), which is an estimate of how much money you’ll make from a single customer over the lifetime of your relationship with them
        - CLV must be greater than your acquisition costs, so
        - don’t forget to break down your revenue numbers across the other metrics.
        - For example, if you look at mobile games produced by companies like Zynga, you’ll find that half of the revenue comes from just 0.15% of the players. These players are known as “whales” and understanding what acquisition, activation, retention, and referral strategies attract more whales is the only way to succeed in such a business
    - The magic number
        - Every company has a “magic number”: some metric that, when the user crosses it, they have an “a-ha” moment and finally “get” the product.
        - The first step is to figure out what the success metric is for your company. When the success metric is going up, your business is succeeding, and when it’s going down, your business is failing.
        - This will vary for every company, but it should be pretty obvious. Facebook and Twitter get most of their revenue from ads, so their success metrics are very closely tied to user engagement (e.g., how many times the user comes back to the site over a 28-day period). Slack is a subscriptions product, so its success might be tied to what percentage of users are paying customers. Etsy is an e-commerce company, so its success metric is probably tied to how many transactions happen on the site. Once you’ve figured out the success metric, the second step is to determine which user actions correlate with an increase in your success metric. Grab a representative subset of your users and plug all the data you have on them (e.g., the acquisition metrics, activation metrics, etc.) into a giant spreadsheet. Once you plot the user activity metrics against your company’s success metric, you’ll sometimes get lucky and find a very obvious correlation.
        - Sometimes it’s not as obvious, and you’ll have to run a regression to find a good correlation.
        - You don’t need to find a perfect correlation and you don’t want to define your magic number as a collection of 25 different factors. Your magic number needs to be inspiring and easy to reason about, so prefer a metric that’s simple and explains most of the variation to one that explains a little more of the variation but at the expense of significantly more complexity.
        - final step is to test it and make sure that it affects your success metric the way you expect. In other words, you need to show cause and effect rather than just correlation, which is usually best done through A/B testing,

---

- Instead of releasing the new feature to all users, you randomly partition users into either group A, which is a control group that doesn’t see the new feature, or group B, which is the experimental group that does get to see it.3 After some amount of time, depending on how long it takes you to get enough website visitors for the results to be statistically meaningful,4 you look at the metrics for group B and see if they are any different from those of group A. If they are, the new feature is the most likely cause, as that should be the only variable that changed between the two groups. If the new feature gets your metrics to improve, you can roll it out to all users. If not, then you throw it away and go back to the drawing board.

- The remarkable thing is that when you use this process and A/B test just before a release, you are likely to find that most of your features either hurt your metrics or have no impact.

- If you want to succeed, you have to build not only a product, but also a way to distribute it. It’s better to think of distribution as something essential to the design of your product. If you’ve invented something new but you haven’t invented an effective way to sell it, you have a bad business — no matter how good the product.

- four most common distribution channels for startups: 
    - Word of mouth: three things you can do to increase distribution through word of mouth: 
        - Build a better product 
            - Build a better product Although no product can truly sell itself, you can come close to this ideal by building a product so good that customers can’t stop talking about
            - Notice that what makes CrossFit worthy of discussing is how different it is. It’s not about having every possible feature
            - (as a fitness program, CrossFit has plenty of gaps and weaknesses), but about being exceptional at a small number of features (see “Focus on the differentiators”). Focusing on your differentiators is not only important for building a great MVP but also for increasing the odds that customers will notice your product because it stands out from the rest.
        - Provide great customer service 
            - No matter how hard you try to build an amazing product, you won’t get everything right. Customers will have questions. They will run into bugs. They will find corner cases and make requests for new functionality.
            - if you do customer service exceptionally well, you can turn it into your differentiator and get powerful word-of-mouth effects:
            - If you really want to be exceptional at customer service, it’s usually not enough to have a separate, outsourced customer service department. Zappos makes every employee participate in customer service (see “Culture fit”). Similarly, every engineer at Stripe, and even the founders, do customer support on a biweekly rotation
            - involving everyone in customer service can scale surprisingly far, as it not only gets you loyal customers who spread the product by word of mouth but also helps you build a better product by making the people who write the code feel the pain of the customers that use it.
        - Build viral loops into your product
            - Virality is no more than another way of saying word of mouth.
            - what you need is not a viral marketing strategy, but to build a viral loop into your product. A viral loop is a feature in the product that gives current users an incentive to recruit new users.
            - the cold start problem. Products like the telephone are subject to Metcalfe’s Law: the value of the product is proportional to the square of the number of users (n2). That means it’s hard to get such a product started (02 is 0), but once you get the ball rolling, you get strong network effects,
            - solve the cold start problem? First, they made it easy to invite non-members to the service by allowing you to import contacts from your email, phone, and other existing networks
            - Second, they offered users something valuable even before the network was large. For example, even when LinkedIn had very few members, it was still useful as a public place to store your résumé so that potential employers and business partners could find you.
    - Marketing: where new customers find out about your product directly from you.
        - Advertising 
            - Advertising is almost synonymous with marketing. You figure out where your potential customers are already directing their attention and you pay money to put a message about your product there.
            - If you’re going to spend money on advertising, you have to set up detailed tracking of your acquisition channels so you can tell if the advertising is working or not
        - PR and media 
            - public relations (PR) is another great way to get a message about your product in front of a large audience. To do that, you have to build relationships with people in the TV and movie industries, journalists, bloggers, and celebrities.
            - For most startups, PR events are unpredictable, occasionally negative, and rarely a sustainable distribution strategy.
        - Email 
            - When done right, email marketing is incredibly effective. When done wrong, it’s just spam. The wrong way to use email is direct marketing, where you buy an email list and send a mass email to a bunch of strangers who have never heard of you.
            - A better way to use email is to build an email list of users who opt in to receive information about your product. For example, you could give users a way to sign up for a newsletter on your landing page
            - Customers often take a long time to make a purchase decision and they may have to see the product over and over again before they warm up to it. Sending an occasional reminder email with useful information can be a great way to turn a warm lead into a paying customer.
            - The best way to use email is to send personalized emails in response to user actions or events the user cares about. For example, every time someone tags you in a photo on Facebook, you get an email.
            - In 2011, LinkedIn launched the “Year in Review” email, an annual email that shows you photos of all of your colleagues who made significant career changes over the last year.
            - The important thing to realize about email is that it’s not a good tool for getting new users (acquisition), but it’s one of the best tools for engaging existing users (activation, retention, referral, and revenue). There are many different kinds of emails you can send, such as welcome emails, onboarding emails, re-engagement emails, and referral campaigns.
        - SEO 
            - Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is optimizing your website so that it ranks highly in search results.
            - If your product has a large amount of unique and valuable content, such as user reviews, discussion forums, or reference material, you may be able to drive thousands or millions of page views more or less for free through SEO.
            - The catch is that the ranking algorithm used by Google and all other search engines is kept secret. Google has published an SEO starter guide and there are many other resources with SEO tips and tricks,6 but there is no guarantee that these correspond to the way the ranking algorithm actually works. Making things even harder is that Google changes its ranking algorithm more than 500 times per year,
            - the most important “optimization” you can do is to have a lot of high-quality content on your website — that is, you need to build a better product
            - All the other optimizations, such as tweaking header titles, URLs, domain names, and meta tags, are also useful but won’t have nearly as big of an impact
        - Social media 
            - social media allows you to engage with users on an individual level, which makes it an effective customer service tool. The only thing it’s not particularly good at is user acquisition.
        - Inbound marketing
            - Inbound marketing is about trying to attract customers’ attention using content they find valuable rather than trying to buy customers’ attention,
            - Think of it as trying to bring customers in using a honeypot (inbound marketing), rather than sending your marketing messages out using a loudspeaker (outbound marketing). Your honeypot can be in the form of a blog, a podcast, a video, a book, or a set of open source tools, and you usually combine it with SEO and social media sharing to help customers find it. The key idea behind inbound marketing is not to try to sell something to the customer, but to try to teach them.
            - Inbound marketing is an especially useful strategy for startups, as they can’t compete with the ad budgets of larger companies but can produce valuable content.
    - Sales 
        - Marketing is about getting the customer to the door (acquisition). Sales is about closing the deal and getting the customer to make a purchase (revenue). If you have a “self-serve” product, such as a website where customers can plug in their credit card information to make a purchase, then your sales and marketing process are largely one and the same.
        - However, there are many kinds of products where sales requires human intervention — a salesperson to take the customer through the process, answer questions, and hash out the details in a contract.
        - The CEO of a company is, in may ways, a salesperson, selling the company’s vision to customers, investors, shareholders, and employees.
        - No one wants to be sold to, but everyone wants to buy something, which is what makes sales such a difficult profession.
        - Broadly speaking, there are three categories of sales: 
            - Automated sales are self-serve systems where a customer can make a purchase without talking to a human representative, such as a checkout form on a website like Amazon.com. 
            - Inside sales are salespeople who do most of their sales in their employer’s workplace. One common type of inside sales is a salesperson who works in a store or dealership and sells products over the counter, such as an employee of an Apple store. Another common type is a salesperson who works in an office and sells products over the phone, email, chat, and web conferencing. For example, many Software as a Service (SaaS) products, such as SalesForce, allow you to sign up for a trial or basic versions of the product online (automated sales) and if you want the more powerful version of the product, you can reach out to a sales representative by phone or email (inside sales). 
            - Outside sales are salespeople who do most of their work at the customer’s workplace. They schedule in-person meetings with customers, give them on-site demos, and spend most of their time traveling to customer sites to talk directly with the relevant stakeholders. Automated sales are the most scalable and cost-efficient option, but they generally only work for low-price products (less than $1,000).
    - Branding
        - it’s not the best product that wins but the product the customer thinks is the best that wins. How a customer thinks about your company — if they think about it at all — is your brand, and trying to influence that perception is called branding. Branding is not a single strategy or marketing campaign, but the sum of all the ways you interact with the customer: it’s what your company logo looks like, what you say in your tagline, how you present the company in your ads, what sort of expertise you give away in your inbound marketing, how your website looks, how your business cards look, what tactics your sales team uses, and how customer service treats the customer. Just as differentiators separate your products from other products, you brand needs to separate your company from other companies.
        - branding has very little to do with concrete products. It’s all about emotions and beliefs. It’s about why the company exists and not what it does

- There are certain technologies that are so complicated, error-prone, and time consuming to build yourself, and solved so well in the open source or commercial world that, as a startup, you should never build them yourself. Here’s a partial list: 
    - Security: cryptography, password storage, credit card storage 
    - Web technologies: HTTP servers, server-side and client-side frameworks 
    - Data systems: databases, NoSQL stores, caches, message queues 
    - Software delivery: version control, build systems, deployment automation 
    - CS 101: basic data structures (map, list, set), sorting algorithms 
    - Libraries for common data formats: XML, HTML, CSV, JSON, URLs 
    - Utility libraries: date/time manipulation, string manipulation, logging 
    - Operating systems 
    - Programming languages 

- The only reason you would ever build one of these systems from scratch is either 
    - you’re using it as a personal side project for learning or
    - your startup has extremely unique requirements for one of these technologies. The latter case is uncommon.

- NoSQL examples:
    - *Key-value stores* are optimized for a single use case: extremely fast lookup by a known identifier. 
        - They are effectively a hash table that is distributed across many servers and persisted to disk. Popular examples include Redis, DynamoDB,
        - Key-value stores do not use schemas, so you can store any kind of value you want. Unfortunately, because most key-value stores treat the values as opaque blobs, they cannot support any query mechanism other than lookups by primary key.
    - *Document stores* are similar to key-value stores in that they allow you to store key-value pairs. The difference is that the document store is aware of the format of the value, so it can support more advanced query functionality.
    - Popular *column-oriented databases* include HBase and Cassandra. On the surface, they look similar to a relational database because they store data in tables that consist of rows and columns. Cassandra even has schemas for tables and a query language called CQL that looks similar to SQL. The major difference is that relational databases are typically row-oriented, which means they are optimized for operations across many rows of data, while column-oriented databases are optimized for operations across many columns.
    - While other NoSQL data stores were primarily motivated by the need to run on clusters, most *graph databases* run on a single node, and are motivated by the need to efficiently store, query, and navigate relationship data. Popular graph databases include Neo4j and

- Even for a simple class, it is complicated to map from the relational representation to the in-memory representation. This is known as an impedance mismatch. Many object-relational mapping (ORM) tools have been built to try to solve this problem,

- Most NoSQL databases are optimized for working on aggregates: a single value in a key-value store, a single document in a document store, or a single column in a column-oriented database.14 While writing a single aggregate is usually easy and guaranteed to be atomic, NoSQL databases give you no guarantees when trying to write multiple aggregates.

- Scalability was one of the main motivations for NoSQL.16 Companies like Google and Amazon were facing availability and performance requirements that exceeded the capabilities of any single server. They had reached the limits of vertical scaling (i.e., adding more RAM or CPU to a single server), so they needed systems that could run on a cluster of servers that could be scaled horizontally (i.e., adding more servers). Once you go from storing data on a single server to multiple servers, you are dealing with a distributed system. All distributed systems are subject to the CAP theorem, which states the following: It is impossible for a distributed computer system to simultaneously provide all three of the following guarantees: Consistency (all nodes see the same data at the same time) Availability (a guarantee that every request receives a response about whether it succeeded or failed) Partition tolerance (the system continues to operate despite arbitrary message loss or failure of part of the system)

- Consistency (C), availability (A), partition tolerance (P): choose two. In practice, it’s always possible that a server will fail or the network will drop messages, so all distributed systems must choose P — that is, you can’t sacrifice partition tolerance [Hale 2010]. So the real question is, in the presence of network partitions, do you maintain consistency or availability? Some systems, such as MongoDB, HBase, and Redis, always try to keep the data consistent on all nodes, so in the case of a network partition, they might lose availability. Other systems, such as Voldemort, Cassandra, Riak, and CouchDB, are eventually consistent, which means that during a network partition, they will remain available, but different nodes may end up with different data and the conflicts will have to be resolved later. In fact, even without a partition, propagating data in a distributed system always takes time, so even during normal operation, eventually consistent systems may have different data in different nodes at least for a short amount of time.

- There are two primary strategies for building a distributed data system that can scale horizontally: replication and partitioning

- Replication involves copying the same data to multiple servers or replicas. One of the key benefits of replication is fault tolerance. Servers and hard drives fail all the time, so no matter what database technology you pick, you need to ensure that a copy of your data is in more than one place to prevent downtime and data loss.

- The bare minimum is replicating data to a standby replica, which doesn’t serve any live traffic but can be swapped in if the primary database goes down. You can also replicate data to one or more active replicas, which serve live traffic, thereby allowing you to horizontally scale your database by adding more replicas. There are two general ways to use replication for scalability: master/slave replication and multi-master replication

- Master/slave replication primarily allows scaling for more read traffic, while multi-master replication allows scaling for both read and write traffic.

- So why not use multi-master replication in all cases? The answer is complexity. Systems with a single writer (a single master) are easier to reason about and maintain, and because most databases see much more read traffic than write traffic, master/slave replication is enough to handle many scalability challenges.

- However, if a single master is becoming a bottleneck for writes, then the complexity of multi-master replication might be worth it. The complexity arises from the fact that a system with multiple writers could simultaneously see two different updates to the same piece of data on two different nodes. This is known as a conflict, and systems that use multi-master replication have to implement a conflict resolution strategy.

- In some cases, merging the writes together can work.

- Other strategies include last write wins, where values with a newer timestamp or vector clock overwrite older ones, and user specified, where all conflicting versions are saved and the client code has to decide which one to keep when it reads the data.

- Whereas replication is copying the same data to multiple servers, partitioning is copying different subsets of the data to different servers. The goal of partitioning is to divide your data set between n servers so that each one only has to handle 1/nth of the total load.

- However, if you don’t partition your data correctly, then one node will receive more load than the others. This is known as a hot spot and it will become a bottleneck for your scaling efforts. To avoid such bottlenecks, you need to select the right partitioning strategy.

- The two main options are vertical partitioning and horizontal partitioning. Vertical partitioning involves splitting up unrelated types of data, such as moving columns into separate tables or tables into separate databases. For example, let’s say you’re building a bank website with just two pages: one for managing your savings account and one for managing your checking account.

- the website becomes popular and the accounts table becomes so large that the database struggles to keep up with the load, one solution is to vertically partition the data by storing the checking and savings account data in two separate tables:

- Because each page of the website shows either the checking account or the savings account but not both, each database now only has to deal with a fraction of the requests.

- partitioning always comes at a cost. For example, you lose the ability to do JOINs.

- Vertical partitioning also doesn’t help if a single table gets too big. For example, if the bank website becomes very popular, just the checking table alone might overwhelm a single server. An alternative is horizontal partitioning (AKA sharding), where you divide up the rows of a single table across separate partitions (AKA shards). For example, if your bank website had 10 servers and 1 million users, you could partition the original accounts and users tables by user_id so that user_id 0 - 100,000 was on server 0, 100,001 - 200,000 was on server 1, and so on

- This strategy works very well for any page that needs the data for a single user because all of that data will be on a single shard.

- For example, whereas a vertical partitioning scheme needed three requests to fetch the username and total balance for a single user_id, with this horizontal partitioning scheme, you need to send just a single query to that user’s shard:

- But there are some serious drawbacks, too. For example, what if you want to find all users who have at least $500 in their accounts? There is no way to know ahead of time which shards those users will be on, so you’ll have to perform a scatter gather query that fans out to all partitions, putting load on all of your shards instead of just one. Horizontal partitioning also makes it more complex to generate IDs. With a single database, it’s easy to use an incrementing counter, but with multiple databases, you have to do extra work to avoid conflicts.

- Peter Drucker, who is considered the founder of modern management, wrote that a manager has five basic operations [Drucker 2008, 8]: Set objectives The manager determines the goals, what needs to be done to achieve the goals, and how to communicate the goals to the team. Organize The manager divides up the work and selects the people to do it. Motivate and communicate Through decisions on pay, placement, and promotion, and through constant communication, the manager “integrates” a group of people into an effective team. Measure The manager establishes targets for each person and measures their progress towards those targets as a way to measure performance. Develop people The manager helps each person on the team, including himself or herself, to grow their abilities.

- There are a number of advantages to a manager-driven, hierarchical organization. The different levels of leadership usually make it clear who has authority and responsibility for any given decision. Employees know who they report to and who evaluates their performance. Teams can become highly specialized and efficient at specific tasks. And finally, it’s a time-tested approach that is well understood and has been proven to work even at a huge scale,

- There are also a number of disadvantages to hierarchical organizations. Communication across departments tends to be difficult. Multiple layers of organization can lead to lots of bureaucratic overhead that slows everything down. Managers can become bottlenecks for all communication and coordination. Compensation, reputation, and recognition are typically tied to where you are in the hierarchy, which leads many people towards a maniacal focus on climbing the ladder and playing politics rather than doing work. Finally, higher-level managers, who are often trusted with the most important decisions, are often the furthest away from the actual work, and therefore in the worst place to make such decisions.

- The alternative to a hierarchical design is a distributed organization (sometimes called a flat organization). The idea is for employees to self-organize into the most efficient structure for each task and then reorganize when the task is completed or changes. Depending on the task, different people may assume leadership and coordination roles, but these depend on the requirements of the task as opposed to a fixed title or rigid hierarchy.

- In the 1960 book The Human Side of Enterprise, Douglas McGregor discusses the common notion that the average worker dislikes their job and avoids it whenever possible. This may be true of some jobs such as dull, repetitive manual labor, and in those cases, you may need a constant managerial presence to coerce the worker with rewards (salary, bonuses) or threaten them with punishments (firing, humiliation). However, this does not apply to many creative jobs such as programming. Many people love using their creativity and building things, so they actually enjoy their jobs and actively seek out problems to solve. All you have to do is provide them with the right environment, and their internal drive will get them to work hard. In other words, management is not a fundamental need of a business but an invention. Management, as we know it today, was developed in the early 20th century to meet the needs of businesses in that era. It’s a tool, and like all tools, it needs to be updated from time to time to meet new requirements. Most management practices we use today were designed to organize manual labor and assembly line workers to do repetitive, dull tasks. The main goal was to “turn human beings into semi-programmable robots” [Hamel 2011]. The requirements of a modern, high-tech startup are very different, so there is no guarantee the same management practices will work.

- The advantage of a flat and distributed organization is that employees have more autonomy and responsibility,

- an essential ingredient in motivation. More autonomy means that the person closest to the problem, who understands it best, gets to make the important decisions

- you’ll need to find alternative ways to handle Drucker’s five management tasks: Set objectives Coordinating large changes and new priorities among many distributed teams can be tricky. Organize In a distributed organization, it’s not always obvious who has the responsibility and authority for any given decision. While management hierarchies have scaled to millions of employees, there are few examples of whether distributed organizations can get that large (though that might not matter for most startups). Motivate and communicate Without a manager, you need a different system for reviewing employees, such as peer review. Without a hierarchy, you also need an alternative to promotions, as I’ll discuss in “Hiring and promotions”. Measure Each team is now responsible for identifying its own targets and milestones, and tracking progress towards them. Develop people It can be tricky to build an effective process for hiring and training people when there are no consistent teams or managers in place.

---

- If you use promotions as rewards, the Peter Principle is the default outcome.

- In short, there is extensive research that shows that the most common methods used in the corporate world to try to improve performance — promising a reward like a raise, promotion, or bonus for the completion of a task — are often counterproductive.

- provide a context that’s optimal for bringing out the internal motivation people already have. To do this, you need to create an environment that maximizes autonomy, mastery, and purpose.

- Autonomy is our natural drive to have control over our lives. We want to decide what we work on, when we work on it, how we work on it, and who we work with. If you want to encourage autonomy, you need to hire people you can trust, set clear goals for them, and then get out of their way.

- Mastery is the inherent drive to get better at things. Most programmers will jump at the opportunity to learn a new technology or hone their skills. We’re naturally attracted to hard problems because we know they will challenge us and force us to get better.

- the book The Alliance by Reid Hoffman,

- In reality, the days of working at the same company for 50 years, climbing the career ladder, and retiring with a gold watch are long gone. The idea behind The Alliance is that the employer and employee should be more up front about this reality. Instead of treating the offer like a lifelong contract, you should agree to tours of duty, which are well-defined missions of a finite length where the employee promises to invest in the company by contributing to specific projects and the company promises to invest in the employee by helping them improve their market value. For example, you might agree to a tour of duty to “ship the new mobile app in 12 months,” and in exchange, the company will improve your market value by helping you develop your iOS and mobile design skills. When you finish a tour of duty, you repeat the conversation with the company and agree to a new tour.

- This approach replaces the vague and uncertain employee review process with something that is more transparent. And instead of only offering extrinsic rewards (e.g., salary), it makes intrinsic rewards (e.g., the company investing in your mastery) an explicit part of the exchange.

- Purpose is the inherent drive to work on something with a bigger meaning. We all crave to build something bigger than ourselves. We want to leave our mark on the world. We need to make money to make this possible, but the money isn’t really the point — it’s just a resource to help us achieve some other purpose.

- Typically, what you’re actually vesting are stock options, which give you the right to purchase (AKA exercise) the stock at a fixed price called the strike price. The strike price represents the fair market value (FMV) of the stock at the time you got your offer. Where does the FMV come from? Usually, it is determined by the Board of Directors based on a process known as the 409A valuation. For example, if the 409A valued the company at $1.1 million, the strike price would be $1,100,000 / 11,000,000 shares = $0.10 per share. After working at the company for four years, you will have vested all of your stock options, but you won’t be able to do anything with them until you exercise them. To exercise all of your stock options, you’d have to pay 100,000 * $0.10 = $10,000. Only after exercising your shares can you actually sell them.

- Initially, shares of stock are worth nothing, because you can’t sell them to anyone (they are not liquid). There are two common types of liquidity events (AKA exits) by which the stock becomes valuable: Initial public offering (IPO) An IPO is when the company sells its stock to the public. IPOs help companies raise money and allow the shareholders (the co-founders, employees, and investors) to sell their stock to the market. Acquisition When a company is acquired, another company buys the stock from your company’s shareholders (i.e., the co-founders, employees, and investors) for cash, its own stock, or some mix of both. For example, if your company had an IPO and the stock price went to $1/share, you would be able to sell your shares for 100,000 * $1 = $100,000. Similarly, if your company were to be acquired, the acquirer may agree to pay $1/share for your stock, in which case you would again get $100,000.

- Any profit you make off of your stock options will be taxed.7 With the IPO example above, your profit would be $100,000 - $10,000 = $90,000.

- two main tax issues related to stock options: short-term versus long-term capital gains and the gotchas of exercising options.

- If you sell your stock options less than one year and one day after exercising them, the profit you make from selling them gets taxed as short-term capital gains. That is, it’s taxed as normal income, as if it were part of your salary. If you were making $50,000 per year and sold all your stock as described in the preceding IPO example, your taxable income for that year would be $50,000 + $90,000 = $140,000. Using an online tax calculator, the federal tax rate on this income is roughly 24%, or $33,600. If you exercise the stock, hold it for at least one year and one day, and then sell it, the profit gets taxed as long-term capital gains, which are subject to a lower tax rate. The federal taxes on your $50,000 salary would be roughly 12%, or $6,000, and the federal taxes on your $90,000 of stock would be 15%, or $13,500, for a total of $19,500. So by holding the stock for at least one year and one day, you pay $14,100 less in federal taxes.

- some companies even let you early exercise your stock, allowing you to exercise it before it has vested. If your company allowed early exercise, you could exercise all of your stock the day you joined the company, so that 4+ years later, when all of your stock is vested, you’ll be able to sell it and immediately get the long-term capital gains tax rate. However, there are two major gotchas you need to be aware of. The first gotcha is obvious: exercising your stock costs money. In this example, you’d need to spend 100,000 * $0.10 = $10,000. If you joined the company later and the fair market value had gone up, the strike price in your offer might have been higher, such as $3.00/share, so exercising your options would cost 100,000 * $3.00 = $300,000. Not everyone has this type of money lying around. Even if you did, it is a high-risk investment, as you have no guarantee the company won’t go out of business a few months later, making all that stock worthless. The second gotcha is more subtle: if the value of the stock is higher than your strike price when you exercise it, you’ll have to pay taxes on the difference between your strike price and the market price — even if you don’t sell any of the stock. For example, let’s say you joined a startup in January 2014, when the strike price was $0.10. You weren’t confident of an IPO, so you didn’t exercise the shares. By January 2018, an IPO seems more likely, so you decide to exercise all your shares. Here’s the catch: by January 2018, it’s possible that the fair market value of the company has gone up. Let’s say it’s now at $5.00 per share. Your strike price is fixed in your contract, so you would still pay $0.10 per share to exercise your stock options for a total of 100,000 * $0.10 = $10,000. However, your shares are now worth 100,000 * $5.00 = $500,000, so you just “made” $500,000 - $10,000 = $490,000 in profit. The fact that you can’t sell the stock and realize any of this profit doesn’t matter — you still have to pay taxes on it. The tax rate on this profit depends on the type of stock. Incentive stock options (ISO) will be taxed under the alternative minimum tax rate, whereas non-qualified stock options (NSO) are taxed as short-term capital gains. Let’s say you had ISOs and your AMT rate worked out to 28%. That means you not only have to pay $10,000 to exercise your shares, but also $490,000 * 0.28 = $137,200 in taxes! And you still have no guarantee that a liquidity event will happen in the future or, even if one does, that the stock will be worth more than $5.00/share.

- note that this equation assumes that you exercised your stock as soon as it vested, but it does not take taxes into account):8 A = Difference between the salary in the offer and a fair market salary B = Number of years you expect to work at the startup C = Cost to exercise your shares D = Percentage of the company you own E = Investor take F = Value of the company in case of a successful exit Investment = (A * B) + C Return = D * (F - E) Let’s say a startup offers you a salary of $50,000 per year, whereas the fair market salary for your role is $65,000. That means you’re “investing” A = $65,000 - $50,000 = $15,000 per year in exchange for possible future returns from the equity. You expect to be at the company for B = 4 years, which is usually long enough to vest all of your stock. In your offer, you get 100,000 shares of stock at a strike price of $0.10 per share, so to exercise all of your shares, you’d have to spend C = 100,000 * $0.10 = $10,000. This means you are investing the following amount in this startup: A = $65,000 - $50,000 = $15,000 B = 4 years C = 100,000 shares * $0.10 / share = $10,000 Investment = ($15,000 * 4) + $10,000 = $70,000 The total number of shares outstanding when you were granted stock was 11 million, so the 100,000 shares you exercised represent 0.9% of the company. However, it’s likely that by the time you reach an exit, your shares will have been diluted because the company has created new option pools to bring in new employees or investors. Let’s say the dilution after four years is 50%, so your 100,000 shares end up representing 0.45% of the company, or D = 0.0045.

- The investor take can have a large impact on the returns you can expect from your shares. This is because investors usually get preferred shares, which means they get to make money off of an exit before anyone else. For example, if the company took $1 million in investment and had a $1 million exit, the investor gets their money back and everyone else gets nothing. This is called a preference and it can even be a multiple of the original investment. For example, if a company raised $1 million at a 2x preference and has a $3 million exit, the investor gets $2 million and everyone else splits the remaining $1 million.

- As a start, you can estimate the investor take as roughly: E = money raised * preference * fudge factor When you get an offer, you need to find out how much money the company has raised from investors in the past and how much it plans to raise in the future and the preference involved (1x is typical these days). It’s not always a good sign when a startup has raised a lot of money, as it means it will have to have a bigger exit in order for everyone to be happy with their returns. The fudge factor is up to you, but be conservative. I generally use a fudge factor of 3x to account for the many tricks investors use to increase their take.

- The best piece of advice on hiring for startups is: don’t do it. Or at least, don’t do it yet. Hiring more people means a higher burn rate, more complexity in running the business, slower decision making, and more time spent searching, interviewing, and training. The best startups do more with less. Be proud of being small and try to accomplish as much as possible with a tiny team. It will teach you to stay focused, make better trade-offs, and develop a passion for high leverage and efficiency. In fact, hiring more people does not necessarily mean you can get more done.

- communication overhead grows as the square of the team size, which is why larger companies can’t move as quickly as smaller ones. Stay small as long as you can. How do you know it’s time to start hiring? The key question to ask is not “what could we do if we hired someone?” but “what couldn’t we do unless we hired someone?” If there is something critical to your business that cannot be done without a new hire, no matter how creative you get, then it’s time to start hiring.

- Do not take finding a co-founder lightly, as you’ll be with them for a long time — on the order of 10 years for a successful startup

- it’s best if you and the co-founder have survived battles together in the past and you know you can depend on each other in the future. This is why former co-workers usually make the best co-founders: if you’ve successfully built something together before, it’s more likely you can do it again. Classmates from college are also a good choice

- There are four traits to look for in a co-founder. First, you want someone who is “relentlessly resourceful” [Graham 2009]. Look for people who you know will get shit done no matter what obstacles are in the way. Second, you want someone with a complementary skill set. For example, if you’re a programmer and good at building products, look for a co-founder who can handle sales and marketing and is good at finding customers. Third, you typically want the co-founders to be similar in age, financial situation, and motivation. It’s not going to work if one co-founder is looking to make a quick buck, while the other has a long-term vision of changing the world. And fourth, most importantly, you want someone you can trust. To build trust, you need to have a history with the person, which underscores one more time why colleagues, classmates, and friends make the best co-founders.

- To make all the co-founders feel like equals and to make sure they all have some “skin in the game,” you should always split the equity evenly (see “Equity”) and enforce a vesting schedule (see “What is vesting?”). No matter who had the idea or how much work they did before the company was founded, an even equity split is almost always the right choice.2 Building a successful startup takes, on average, a decade, so instead of bickering over percentage points and creating resentment on day one, make sure everyone has equal incentive to see this thing through in the long term.

- Take your time with finding the first few hires at a startup. You can recover from building the wrong product or using the wrong technology, but a bad hire in the first 5–10 employees can kill a company. The early employees, along with the co-founders, are responsible for defining the company culture, and you can’t afford to get it wrong.

- realize that most founders spend about 25%–50% of their time sitting in coffee shops talking about their vision

- In the early days, almost all of your hires should come in through referrals. Over time, this percentage will drop, but try to never let it dip below 40%–50%. If it does, it means you’re either not doing enough to encourage referrals or, even worse, your employees can’t recommend your company to their friends

- Cal Newport argues that elite performance not only requires a lot of practice but specifically deliberate practice. Deliberate practice means you have a feedback mechanism that lets you track your level of performance, and in each practice session, you intentionally choose activities that push you just beyond your capabilities.

- deliberate practice will stretch your abilities, and stretching usually involves a fair amount of discomfort. Deliberate practice is “often the opposite of enjoyable” [Newport 2012, 97]. Just as a weightlifter gets used to the sensation of physical exertion and seeks out activities that make their muscles burn, you need to become accustomed to the sensation of mental exertion and seek out tasks that strain your mind.

- In The Pragmatic Programmer, Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas recommend that you think of your learning as building a knowledge portfolio that you manage, similar to a financial portfolio

- You can only spend 10,000 hours a handful of times in your life, so you need to invest regularly (make learning a regular habit) and choose your investments wisely. To keep your portfolio diversified and balanced between conservative and high-risk investments, you need to keep up with industry trends to see what skills and techniques are valuable today, and what is just appearing on the horizon and likely to be valuable tomorrow.

- It may take 10,000 hours to develop mastery, but you can develop familiarity with a new skill much faster. In The First 20 Hours, Josh Kaufman shows how you can learn the basics of a new skill — such as a new sport, a new musical instrument, or a new programming language — in just 20 hours, or roughly two 20-minute sessions, every day, for a month. To make this work, you have to dedicate time to learning.

- Three most common learning techniques
    - Study: three things that make my study time more effective. 
        - First, set concrete, measurable goals.
            - for 2015, I set a goal of reading 30 books
            - goal of learning at least one major new technology every year,
        - Second, take notes. For example, I try to summarize every book I read and save my favorite quotes
        - third, involve your friends and coworkers in the learning process.
            - reading group that selected a new computer science paper every few weeks and got together to discuss it.
            - study group of people who took the “Functional Programming in Scala” course on Coursera.
            - public commitments are a great way to make sure you follow through with your learning.
    - Build:
        - until you start making things, most of your learning, whether from books or from school, will feel largely useless.
        - It’s only when you need to build something that these skills become useful,
        - If you’re having trouble motivating yourself to read, the best thing you can do is to find a project where you have to build something you don’t know how to build. Do that, and the reading will take care of itself. In the spirit of deliberate practice, find projects that will stretch your abilities.
    - Share: the best companies and programmers tend to share almost everything they do. The reason is that sharing gives back more than you put in, in the form of... 
        - Mastery 
            - The best way to learn is to teach. To explain a topic to someone else, you have to understand it more deeply yourself.
            - Taking the time to share your knowledge is one of the easiest and most effective ways to level-up.
        - Quality 
            - When is your home cleanest? Just before guests arrive. The same is true of anything that you share with others. 
            - One of the unexpected benefits of open sourcing your code is that the mere act of preparing the code for open source often leads to higher-quality code because you know that “guests” will be looking at it. You’ll probably take the time to clean up the code, add tests, write documentation, and generally make the project more presentable to the rest of the world.
        - Labor 
            - Every time someone uses your open source code and files a bug, they are doing QA, for free.
            - Sharing your work with others allows the entire software community to contribute, which makes it possible for projects to become larger and higher quality than anything you could do on your own
        - Marketing 
            - If you’re a developer, the best way to make yourself look good in front of an employer is to share you work. 
            - Think of it like inbound marketing for your career
        - Ownership 
            - As a developer, if I put thousands of hours of effort into a project, I tend to get attached to it. It’s my baby. If it’s a proprietary project, leaving the company is a bit like getting a divorce and losing custody of the kids.
            - However, if you get to give talks about the work, publish blog posts and papers, and best of all, open source your project, then it’s yours for life. It becomes a permanent part of your toolbelt, something you can take with you anywhere you go,
