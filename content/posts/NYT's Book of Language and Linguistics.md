Humans and chimpanzees diverged about 8 million years ago.

It's not only the neural centers that prevent chimpanzees from complex language: it's actually the vocal apparatus, as well.

Language dates back about 50,000 years, around the same time as the first part objects and a rapid acceleration in the pace of technological innovation.

Based on the evidence from fossil draws, those first humans could not have made vowels other than the tense mid-front /e/.

The hypothetical protolanguage "Nostratic" is largely a product of research in the former Soviet Union. It is hypothesized to have been spoken in the Middle East sometime between 20,000 and 12,000 years ago.

Indo-European was probably spoken around the Caspian and Black Seas for a few thousand years after 5000 BC.

Etruscan and Basque are the only decently-documented pre-Indo-European languages in Europe.

There are two competing theories about how Indo-European languages entered the European peninsula.

1. The first is that warlike peoples spread out from the Pontic Steppe north of the black sea around 6500 years ago.
2. The second is that early agrarians from the Middle East slowly spread out in search of new lands starting around 9000 years ago.

Sumerians were the first to develop writing, in 3200-3300 BC. It took about five centuries before the semi-pictorial script begin to represent spoken language sounds. It coevolved with a list/category system for agrarian, economic administration.

Convergent evolution:

- Greek, Armenian, and Sanskrit each independently shifted the meaning of the Indo-European word for "winter" to mean "snow."
- This poses difficulties in linguistic genealogy, because those three languages aren't, for example, closely linked: the shift happened at different times.

The /k/ phoneme, when word-initial, becomes the /h/ phoneme in German languages: e.g. horn, hundred, heart.

The now-extinct Anatolian language was the first to split off of proto-Indo-European.

Tocharian has many genetic similarities to Celtic and Germanic languages, but did not evolve from them: instead, they likely all split from Indo-Hittite.

Indo-European speakers came to the Tarim Basin between 4000 and 2000 years ago; likely, wheeled wagons were behind this diffusion.

The "Caucasoid" mummies in the Tarim Basin also included ritual horse burials similar to those in Ukraine from 5000 years ago, and looms for producing wool twill with plaid (_which were present in the ancient Mediterranean, but not contemporary China._)

The multiple migrations into the basin were likely multigenerational, short-distance pastoral wanderings.

_Homo Erectus_ left Africa 1-2 million years ago; _Homo Sapiens_, 100,000 years ago.

Humans had populated every continent by 60,000 years ago. (_Boats and rafts were also common by then._)

Agriculture developed in the Middle East 10,000 years ago. From there, farmers slowly expanded into Europe (_now present only as the Basques._)

Horses were domesticated along the Ukrainian steppe between 6,000 and 4,000 years ago. These people, Indo-European speakers, then quickly spread across Europe. (_This is the "Kurgan hypothesis."_)

The Sahara became a desert 3,000-4,000 years ago; prior, it was the center of farming in Africa.

Three migrations across the Bering Strait occurred, resulting in three genetically-distinct groups of pre-Colombian North Americans (_Eskimo, Na-Dene, and Amerindians, the earliest arrivals at 30,000 years ago._)

Counterintuitively, the smaller the village the greater the genetic variation between families. Fewer individuals to breed with exaggerates the impact of random genetic variations.

Aboriginal Australians are genetically similar to the Chinese.

Neanderthals went extinct 30,000 years ago.

Among primates, there is a correlation between brain size and the size of living groups.

The earliest uneqivocal evidence for human speech is the cave art of modern _Homo sapiens_, around 40,000 years ago.

Anatomically, though, it’s possible that earlier _Homo_ species (_including Neanderthals_) could speak.

The **hypoglossal canal** is a hole at the base of the skull through which nerve fibers connect the brain to the tongue muscles.

- In chimpanzees, it’s half the size of modern humans; however,
- among the _Homo_ species, it reached current size range around 400,000 years ago.

The larynx position, too, determines speech ability.

- among apes, it sits high in the neck; among humans, it’s lower.
- This allows humans to make a wider range of sounds, but also makes us the only mammals incapable of simultaneously drinking and breathing.

Human infants, too, are born with a high larynx; only when it descends do they develop full linguistic fluency.

Even if Neanderthals spoke, however, they wouldn’t have the anatomy to produce the /e/, /i/, and /u/ phonemes.

The planum temporale is a slim piece of tissue runs along the side of the head, and is connected to the ears.

- In ~2/3 of humans, it is significantly larger on the left side of the brain; no other animal has the same asymmetry in this brain region, save for chimpanzees.
- For many years, scientists believed that the planum temporale was the core of speech-sound processing; now, it seems more likely that
  1. complex language functions are distributed across brain regions, and
  2. humans did not evolve new brain structures for language but rather adapted preexisting ones.

There is tremendous variability in which region of the brain is used for language; it can even shift after e.g. childhood injury.

Generative grammar - the ability to string word monads into semantically-coherent sentences of arbitrary length and complexity.

African elephants can communicate up to 2 1/2 miles via infrasonic (_low-frequency, at 14-35 hertz_) calls, below the range of human hearing (_which starts at 30 hertz._) They do so to coordinate movement and spacing such that all members of the group can eat, but also respond quickly to danger.

Whale songs include (_spectrographic_) rhyme, presumably as a mnemonic device. Each whale sings the same themes in the same sequence, but they skip different parts of that sequence (_similar to a round-song where singers go silent at different times._) Only the males sing — presumably, it establishes territories and facilitates mating.

By age three, Japanese babies (_who haven’t been exposed to languages in which the /l/ phoneme is present_) have lost the ability to distinguish it from /r/ — though they were able to do so prior.

A **synapse** is a connection between brain cells.

- A newborn has fewer synapses than an adult;
- by age 2, they’re equal to adults and continue to grow rapidly, until
- at age 10 they remain vastly greater than those of an adult;
- they then diminish in density until age 16, at which point
- their synapse-density is equal to an adult’s.

Until age 10, however, the rapid growth masks the fact that little-used synapses are also constantly and heavily pruned during this time.

**Wernicke’s area** focuses on semantics; **Broca’s area** on motor phonology and grammatical rules.

- Learning a language from birth results in one of each area;
- learning a language (_even to native fluency_) from age 11 onwards results in
  - one Wernicke’s area (_which can handle the simpler semantic mapping of multiple languages_), but
  - two Broca’s areas (_as the first has wired itself only to deal with the complexities of one language._)

**Hebbian learning**:

- Two nerve cells can be connected by an axon. When one nerve cell fires, its partner will also start to fire. Soon, every time the former fires, the second will also fire.
- “_Cells that fire together, wire together_”: larger patterns of simultaneously-firing nerve cells are the source of associative learning.

The Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition at the University of Pittsburgh created an intervention in which used exaggerated (_along their frequency/formant_) minimal pairs to first separate, then redistinguish, the embedded Hebbian circuits that process the /r/ and /l/ phonemes among L1-Japanese speakers. It began with hugely differentiated versions of each sound, then moved them closer to actual native production. Supposedly, it had decent results.

The normal neurological path for reading is:

1.  from the primary visual cortex (_which registers whatever the eyes record_) to
1.  the angular gyrus (_which translates the images into their corresponding linguistic sounds_) to
1.  the superior temporal gyrus, aka Wernicke’s area. 

Readers with dyslexia instead leap directly from the visual cortex to the inferior frontal gyrus, aka Broca’s area.

Wernicke’s area and Broca’s area are each about the size of a grape. Each person uses these for language processing: but they also have an individual pattern of other language-processing regions. (_Many of these regions are located in the temporal and parietal lobes._)

Grammar is distributed widely: a lesion in Broca’s area will cause... 
* English speakers to elide articles (_which carry little semantic weight_) 70% of the time; 
* Italian speakers (_for whom articles also convey gender and quantity_), 25% of the time; and 
* German speakers (_for whom articles also convey grammatical case_), only 5% of the time. 

Because the article is so grammatically important in the latter languages, the brain will have distributed the patterns that interact with it across multiple regions.

The temporal lobes at the sides of the head process the pattern of frequencies we call "pitch," both for music and for vocal-cord vibrations.

The temporal lobe is connected to the frontal lobe (_where higher-order decision-making occurs._) This processes e.g. repetitions on a theme, and the resulting expectations (_based on exposure to a given musical tradition's patterns_) allow for the "subtle violations" of the next expected note.

There is no single "musical talent," at least not in terms of neurological activity.

In a UC-Irvine study, three year-olds who received musical training for one year scored 80% better than a control group on tests of spatial and temporal reasoning.

The fibers that connect to the left and right hemispheres -- the **corpus callosum** -- are larger in women than men. In particular, the splenium and the isthmus (_both at the back of the corpus callosum_) are larger; these tie together areas of the brain that control some aspects of speech.

Education and experience largely override any contributions of sex difference in brain structure.

The size of the splenium correlates to verbal fluency test scores, within a sex as well.

The front of the corpus callosum decreases in size between age 40 and 70 for men, but not for women.

The brain regions for language are more centralized in men than in women.

Most reading disabilities stem from a difficulty in breaking words down into their phonemic units: one test is to ask someone to say "philosophy" without the "la" sound or "Germany" without the "ma" sound.

Men use a region about a centimeter in diameter near Broca's area (_on the front left side of the brain_) to decode letters into phonemes; about 2/3 of women use that region, but also a region diametrically opposed on the right side of the brain.

The Olmec were a pre-Mayan people lived along the Gulf of Mexico, in what is now the state of Veracruz and Tabasco. 
* They developed one of the earliest major civilizations in the Americas, from 1200 to 500 BC. 
* They built no great cities, but developed a wide trade network. 
* The contemporary Mixe-Zoquean language family is spoken by about 100,000 villagers in Veracruz, Tabasco, Chiapas, and Oaxaca; it descends from the original Olmec language.

Both the Olmec and the Maya practiced bloodletting from the penis as a rite of renewal among nobles.

Linear A (_from Crete_), the language of Easter Island, and the early languages of the Indus River Valley all have yet to be deciphered.

Dr. Joseph Greenberg at Stanford focused on similarities between words in different languages; this work very well for clustering the languages of Africa into four major families. 

However, many believe that (_because he never bothers to establish regular rules governing how words' phonemes change as one language morphs into another_) his methodology is too lax to be conclusive. 

He calls this methodology "mass multilateral comparison."

Na-Dene is related to Ket, a Siberian language.

The major, long-standing debate is whether the brain handles language through specifically-dedicated language organs (_Chomsky_), or through a more general-purpose, distributed cognitive system (_scientists._)

A large London family is unable to speak, due to a mutation in the FOXP2 gene (_living on chromosome seven._) FOXP2 produces a protein that binds to different sites, signaling to sell to activate nearby gene that, presumably, construct the human language faculty.

The fact that there are other learning and processing issues associated with these mutations implies that there are somewhat language-specific mechanisms, but that they are integrated within the larger cognitive system.

The Max Planck Institute decoded the sequence of DNA within the FOXP2 gene for mice, chimpanzees, and other primates in order to study its evolutionary history. The gene remained largely unaltered during the evolution of mammals, but suddenly changed in humans after the hominid line had split off from chimpanzees.

There are two major changes in the gene; one, a slight alteration to the shape of the protein; the other, an expanded role in signaling circuitry.

The age of the genetic mutation can be roughly inferred by the variance of smaller mutations within that gene across the population; these place the FOXP2 gene's major change at no greater than 120,000 years ago.

Dr. Richard Klein at Stanford University proposes that the emergence of behaviorally modern humans, around 50,000 years ago, was triggered by this genetic change (_and subsequent acquisition of language_), given that human remains from this period are physically indistinguishable otherwise.
