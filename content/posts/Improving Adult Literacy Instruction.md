Notes excerpted from [paper available here.](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/13242/improving-adult-literacy-instruction-options-for-practice-and-research)

## Foundations of Reading

- **Literacy texts** should:
  1. build useful vocabulary,
  1. build content (_e.g. topic, world_) knowledge, and
  1. focus attention on new knowledge/skills that relate to (whatever components of reading the learner needs to develop.)
- The texts of everyday life, however, are not written to scaffold such skills: and so require adaptation to do this third task, especially.
- Use literacy texts (_and activities!_) that would be valued by society/learners even _outside_ the context of instruction.

---

## Components of Reading

- **Decoding**
  - One large study compared gains from a variety of instructional approaches in 130 ABE classrooms; it found that the greatest gain was found for structured instruction in alphabetics ([Alamprese, 2009](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3232465/)).
  - Teaching phonological awareness is most effective when coupled with learning the letter-sound correspondences.
  - Explicitly and systematically teach all aspects of the word-reading system:
      - letter-sound patterns,
      - high-frequency spelling patterns (_oat, at, end, ar_),
      - consonant blends (_st-, bl-, cr-_),
      - vowel combinations (_ai, oa, ea_),
      - affixes (_pre-, sub-, -ing, -ly_), and
      - irregular high-frequency word instruction (_sight words that do not follow regular spelling patterns_)
  - Teach “word attack” strategies (_that is, particular attention to challenges posed by multisyllabic words and variable vowel pronunciations_):
      - phonological decoding and blending,
      - word identification by analogy,
      - peeling off prefixes and suffixes,
      - facility with variable vowel pronunciations
- **Fluency**
  - Guided repeated reading (in which learner receives feedback and is supported in identifying and correcting mistakes) has generally led to moderate increases in fluency/accuracy/comprehension.
  - Repeated reading of a text without guidance has not been reliably demonstrated to be effective.
- **Vocabulary**
  - One needs at least 3,000 words in a second language to read independently in that language.
  - To comprehend a college-level academic text, a vocabulary of about 9,000 words is needed.
  - Vocabulary develops not only through explicit teaching but also through routine exposure to language, especially print, which contains words and word structures used less often in speech.
  - Select words from the curriculum and teach their meanings prior to reading a text
  - Introduce vocabulary through connected language (_discussion, elaboration activities_), instead of only dictionary definitions.
  - Provide multiple opportunities to interact with new words and word meanings in a variety of (_engaging_) contexts
- **Comprehension**
  - Comprehension requires the reader to interpret and integrate information from various sources:
      - the sentence being read,
      - the prior sentence,
      - prior text,
      - background knowledge, and
      - extraneous information.
  - Two types of coherence relations (_referential and causal_) are central to many types of texts; readers also use other relations in text (_spatial, temporal, logical, intentional_) to create meaning
  - Understanding of text improves if readers are asked to state [_reading goals, predictions, questions, and reactions_] to the material.
  - Focusing students’ attention on the content of the text through the use of open-ended questions was more effective than strategy instruction.
  - Comprehension involves drawing on  preexisting knowledge, beliefs, and opinions. (_The more one knows about a topic, the more-easily/better one comprehends the material._)
  - Some basic processes have been shown to be affected by the cultural context in which an individual was raised, such as:
    - categorization,
    - perception of an object in relation to its background, and
    - making causal attributes.

## Foundations of Writing

- Reading comprehension improves with frequent writing.
- Two common practices among exceptional literacy teachers are:
  - dedicating time to writing and writing instruction across the curriculum and
  - involving students in varying forms of writing over time.
- Making explicit the connections between reading and writing systems will:
  - facilitate skill development,
  - contribute to metalinguistic awareness, and
  - enhance \[retrieval of , and access to\] text forms and meanings.
- The following **foundational writing skills** need to be explicitly taught to the point of automaticity.
  - Sentence construction, i.e. selecting the right [_words, syntactic structure_] to convey the intended meaning);
  - Text transcription skills, i.e. spelling, handwriting, keyboarding, capitalization, punctuation.
- **Effective writing-instruction practices**, in descending order of impact:
  1. Strategy instruction;
  1. Summarizing reading passages in writing;
  1. Peer assistance in planning, drafting, and revising;
  1. Setting clear, specific writing goals;
  1. Regular typing practice;
  1. Instruction in combining short sentences into complex ones;
  1. Process approach;
  1. Prewriting activities;
  1. Analyzing/imitating models of good writing.
- **Writing strategies** include:
  - goal setting and planning (_establishing rhetorical goals and tactics to achieve them_),
  - seeking information (_gathering information pertinent to the writing topic_),
  - record-keeping (_making notes_),
  - organizing (_ordering notes_),
  - transforming (_visualizing a character to facilitate written description_),
  - self-monitoring (_checking whether writing goals are met_),
  - reviewing records (_reviewing notes or the text produced so far_),
  - revising (_modifying text or plans_),
  - environmental structuring (_finding a quiet place to write_),
  - time planning (_estimating and budgeting time for writing_),
  - seeking social assistance (_asking another person to edit the paper._)
  - Of these, explicit teaching of strategies for _planning and revising_ has a strong and positive effect on the writing of developing/struggling writers.
- The **process approach**:
  - Stresses extended writing opportunities, writing for authentic audiences, personalized instruction, and cycles of writing.
  - Relies mainly on incidental and informal methods of instruction.
  - Produces smaller average effects than (_methods that involve systematic instruction of writing strategies_).
  - Is not effective for students who are weaker writers.
- **Cognitive process approaches,** by constrast, focus on helping students:
  - be attentive to the needs of audiences,
  - become aware of times when they might be prone to writer’s block,
  - become aware of times when they might overedit their writing.
- Explicitly **correcting errors** is less effective than explicitly teaching types of error patterns, or teaching students to identify errors in their own writing.
- According to the [Grief, Meyer, and Burgess (2007) report](https://dera.ioe.ac.uk/22303/2/doc_3346.pdf), in **classes with the greatest increases in writing scores**:
    - Learners did spend time on the composition of texts of different kinds;
    - Writing skills (_e.g. spelling, grammatical correctness, and punctuation_) were developed in the context of meaningful writing tasks;
    - Time was allocated to discuss the writing process and the writing task; and
    - Individual feedback and support were provided as learners drafted, revised, and proofed their work.
    - **Effective instructional practices** included:
      - Explicit framing for the learner of: 
          1. what is to be learned, 
          1. the activities to be completed, and 
          1. how these will help the learner;
      - Focusing attention on how language is structured, while simultaneously encouraging/supporting talk in the L2;
      - Repeated reviewing and reworking of linguistic items (_e.g., new words or structures_) in different contexts;
      - Learning spoken and written language for practical purposes;
      - Collaborative group work.

## Principles of Learning for Instructional Design

- Learners who achieve expertise tend to:
  - formulate learning goals,
  - track progress on these goals,
  - identify their own knowledge deficits,
  - detect contradictions,
  - ask good questions,
  - search relevant information sources for answers, and
  - make inferences when answers are not directly available.
- **Transfer and generalization** of skills/content can be very difficult when both:
  - The material/practices differ between the contexts of training and application, and
  - the similarities between the two are not highlighted or recognized.
  - For example: in one study, college students experienced zero transfer between successive problems when the problems were structurally identical at a deep level, but had different surface features (_e.g., missionaries and cannibals versus monsters and globes._)

---

- Learners need to get a coherent, well-connected **representation of the main ideas** to be learned:
  - Outlines can be used to show structural hierarchies,
  - Graphic organizers show the structure of interrelated ideas pictorially,
  - Tables can be used to organize ideas in two or three dimensions, and
  - Diagrams can help to convey more complex relationships.
  - Graphics do not have to be realistic to be useful: sometimes an abstracted or schematic picture will best illustrate a key idea.
- The **segmentation principle**: new material should be presented in discrete units.
- The **contiguity principle**: materials and lesson plans should be organized so that the elements and ideas to be related are presented near each other in space and time.
- Remove any irrelevant information, even if interesting, to minimize cognitive load and competing demands on attention.
- People will learn most from a text that appeals to some of what they already know.
- Information is **encoded and remembered better** when it is delivered in multiple:
  - modes (_verbal and pictorial)_,
  - sensory modalities (_auditory and visual_), or
  - media (_computers and lectures._)
  - However, the amount of information should not overwhelm the learner to the point of attention being split.

---

- According to Vygotsky’s (1986) **zone of proximal development**, the effectiveness of a text, technology, tutor, or instructional approach can be assessed by comparing performance with and without the supports provided in the intervention.
- Text assignments should push the envelope on text difficulty (per Lexile scores and other text characteristics), but not too far beyond what the student can handle.
  - Readers with low lexical decoding benefited most from explicit teacher-managed code-focused instruction; this instruction was not helpful to readers with higher lexical decoding skills but low vocabulary.
  - Readers with low vocabulary needed a combination of explicit teacher-managed code-focused instruction and explicit meaning-focused instruction.
  - Those with high vocabulary benefited from explicit meaning-focused instruction or independent reading. Indeed, students with high lexical decoding skills and vocabulary would best be left alone to conduct independent reading on topics they are interested in.

---

- It's better to distribute the presentation of materials and tests over time, to space the same amount of study over days and weeks. **Reexposure to course material** after a delay often markedly increases the amount of information that students remember.
- Regular testing:
  - can be quite brief and embedded in instructional materials,
  - still keeps students constantly engaged in the material,
  - guides instructors or computers in making decisions about what to teach.
  - Students benefit more from repeated testing when they expect a final exam than when they do not expect one.

---

- It is important to **link concepts to concrete perceptions and actions**.
  - Perceptual-motor experience (embodied cognition) is particularly important when:
      - there is a need for precision of ideas and communication, and
      - when a concept is first introduced.
  - There’s substantial evidence that stories are easier to read, comprehend, and remember than other types of learning materials.
  - Active experiencing (a theatrical technique in which dialogue is learned by acting out scenes with physical and emotional expression) facilitates learning large passages of dialogue without explicit memorization.
  - Benefits of connecting and interleaving both abstract and concrete representations of problems, particularly in STEM:
      - Students have an easier time acquiring an initial understanding of a concept presented in a concrete form, but
      - they also need a more abstract symbolic representation to apply that knowledge in a different context.

---

- Learning is enhanced when **learners produce answers** themselves instead of reading or recognizing them. Examples include:
  1. In peer tutoring, tutors learn more than tutees when students start out on an even playing field.
  1. Outlining, integrating, and synthesizing information produce better learning than rereading materials. 
  1. Learners can develop their own mini-tests:
        - restating the information in their own words (without viewing the text), or
        - synthesizing information from multiple sources (e.g. classroom and textbook.)
  1. Constructing explanations and arguments.
        - Examples include:
          - causal analyses of events,
          - logical justifications of claims, and
          - functional rationales for actions.
        - Student explanations can be improved by:
          - explicit instruction on self-explanations, and
          - setting up peer collaborations.
        - Explanations of material/reasoning are elicited by deep questions, such as:
          - _why_, _how_, _what-if_, and _what-if not_,
          - as opposed to shallow questions that require the learner to simply fill in missing words (such as _who_, _what_, _where_, and _when_.)
  1.  One method of stimulating thought, content generation, and reasoning is to present some challenges, obstacles, or contradictions that place the learner in “cognitive disequilibrium.”
        - Presenting a challenging problem before students read a text stimulates deeper learning during text comprehension.
        - Readers often do not notice blatant contradictions (e.g., burying survivors, tranquilizing stimulants) that on second glance appear to be quite obvious.
        - As such, explicit instruction in monitoring coherence and self-explanation may be especially useful here.
- Learner-generated content can lack detail and contain misconceptions, however, that need to be monitored.
- Students learn more by alternating between studying examples of worked-out problem solutions and solving similar problems on their own than they do when just given problems to solve on their own.

---

- **modeling-scaffolding-fading** is when:
    - the expert first models the solution, then
    - the student tries with periodic feedback and scaffolding from the expert, and then
    - the expert assistance eventually fades.
- **Mnemonic training**, especially if embedded in otherwise valued classroom literacy activities, may be more effective in augmenting the repertoire of memory skills of adolescents and young adults than of children.
- **Strategy instruction** should be deeply integrated with subject-matter content rather than being lists of abstract rules or scripted procedures that ignore the content.
    - Comprehension skills and strategies are facilitated when they are embedded in content areas.
    - Comprehension can improve after instruction on the structure of expository text (such as compare-contrast, problem-solution, cause-effect, description, sequence, etc.)

---

- Feedback should both:
  - point out errors to the learner, and
  - explain why the information is incorrect.
- The optimal **timing of feedback** depends on the task.
  - Immediate feedback has the advantages of
      - maximizing contiguity of correct information, and
      - preventing elaboration of incorrect information.
  - However, immediate feedback has potential liabilities:
      - A learner’s motivation can be threatened;
      - Frequent interruptions can be counterproductive in the acquisition of complex skills;
      - It blocks the possibility of the students’ correcting their own reading errors and regulating their own learning more generally.
  - How to draw the learner’s attention to an error in a linguistic structure without disrupting communicative interactions?
      - Importance of giving feedback on what is not an acceptable form, even when the form is comprehensible.
      - Importance of explicitly teaching the structures to prevent and correct such errors.
      - Learning wrong information can be reduced when feedback is immediate.
  - Recasts are useful because they can occur as part of the conversation and do not disrupt the flow of communication.
      - Recasts are more effective when made more explicit (e.g., signaling the error with stress).
      - Learning from recasts can be limited unless:
          1. classroom instruction focuses explicitly on language itself (through explicit prior instruction on the form, for example), or
          1. the learners are at a more advanced stage.
  - Encouraging a learner to generate the correct form can be effective for learning (_again, the generation effect: learning is enhanced when learners produce answers, in comparison to having them recognize answers._)
- **Quantitative feedback** is more effective if it is framed in terms of positive feedback, and relative to goal attainment (rather than a raw score.)
- More research is needed on the type of **qualitative feedback** that is optimal.
  - learners benefit from \[feedback specific to the immediate momentary task at hand\], containing hints that prompt them to generate knowledge.
  - Methods include reciprocal teaching, model-scaffold-fade, Socratic dialogs, and refutation.

## Literacy Instruction for Adults

### Background of Learners

- Two major settings:
    1. **Adult Education programs**
       - 2.6 million adults enrolled (2006-2007 fiscal year)
       - Federal and state funding together provides about two-thirds of the funding
       - Median budget for a program was \$199,000;
       - Median enrollment of 318 learners per program;
       - Median expenditure per learner, then, was \$626.
       - Three main types of literacy instruction:
          - 43 percent of adult learners receive _ESL instruction_,
          - 40 percent receive _ABE instruction_,
          - 19 percent participate in _ASE instruction_.
       - Of total programs surveyed,
          - _Local education agencies_ composed 54 percent;
          - _Community-based organizations_ composed 25 percent;
          - _Community colleges_ composed 17 percent;
          - _Correctional institutions_ composed 2 percent.
       - There is not a straightforward alignment of learning goals with program type/location.
       - On average, learners participated in adult education programs for less than 100 hours per year.
          - By contrast, about 3,000 hours are required for mastery of a complex skill. (_An hour per day from kindergarten through twelfth grade amounts to about 2,000 hours in total._)
          - One-third of adults made reading gains equivalent to a grade level during the program year.
          - Those who persisted tended to be older, with poorer basic reading skills.
    1. **Developmental courses in colleges**
       - Two subtypes:
          - Adult literacy programs for individuals who wish to complete their secondary education (_see above_), and
          - Developmental education for students formally enrolled in college programs.
              - Currently, no universally accepted definition of college readiness.
              - More than half of community college students enroll in at least one developmental education course during their college tenure.
- Within those settings, there's a still-greater diversity of populations:
  - high school dropouts,
  - students with documented disabilities,
  - students in career and technical education,
  - academically underprepared college students,
  - other adults who fared poorly in the K-12 system, and
  - low-literate **English language learners with varying levels of first language literacy.**
      - Of Americans 5 years or older, 19.6% speak a language other than English at home.
        - 18% are below the poverty level (versus 11.6% who speak English at home)
        - 31.2% have less than a high school education (vs 11.7% of English speakers)
        - English language learners are the largest group enrolled in adult education programs, with 43% in English as a second language (ESL) programs.
        - In 2006-2007, more than 1 million adults were enrolled in ESL programs (this does not include ELL’s in ABE/ASE programs.)
      - [A 7-year longitudinal study of non-credit ESL classes](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED506600.pdf) showed that only about 8 percent of learners made the transition to other academic (credit) studies.
        - 44 percent advanced only one literacy level.
        - Most of those who advanced took on average 50 to 149 hours of attendance (usually referred to as “100 instruction hours”) to advance one level.
      - The numbers of adults in ESL classes who have limited education in their home countries continues to grow.
        - Among adults, years of education in the primary language (_partially_) correlates with English literacy development.
        - Self-reported language proficiency of Hispanic learners predicted both initial levels of English reading and rates of improvement.
        - Similar results were not found, however, for Asians who spoke various first languages, such as Chinese, Filipino, or Korean.


### Literacy-Specific Practices 

- Instruction that focuses the learner’s attention is needed to isolate and highlight the crucial parts of the input, especially with complex structures of syntax.
  - Students have trouble discovering important principles on their own.
  - Through intensive exposure to language, learners develop an implicit understanding of the patterns in a language: but these incidental opportunities for learning about the structure of a language are not sufficient, especially for more complex structures.
  - English language learners are usually exposed to much more input than they can process, and
  - learners continually test hypotheses and filter input through knowledge of their first language.
  - Explicit teaching that included rule explanation produced stronger effects than implicit teaching that included neither
      - rule presentation nor
      - directions to attend to particular linguistic forms
  - Comparable results were produced from:
      - instruction that begins with learners doing meaningful tasks but also presents opportunities to provide information about linguistic structures, and
      - instruction in which an ordered sequence of linguistic forms is taught outside a communicative context.
- When the first language is used as an aid to clarify instructions and tasks, learners show more growth in second language reading comprehension and oral proficiency.
- It is not a good strategy to provide only oral language instruction while waiting until reading and writing reach a certain level of proficiency.
- Those with weak second language skills tend to devote more attention to form and less attention to the macro processes of generating ideas, planning, revising, and editing.
  - We must understand more about how to develop these macro processes in second language instruction.
  - Promising instructional strategies include prediscussions of the writing topic, peers evaluating and responding to each other’s work, and teacher-student dialogue journals.
  - Extensive reading and vocabulary development in the second language are also helpful.

### Task-Based Language Teaching

- The first step is to analyze:
  1. the learners' practical literacy needs (_e.g., reading technical manuals, communicating with a child’s teacher, navigating bureaucratic mazes, taking lecture notes_) and
  1. the learner’s developmental levels.
- “_Genuine materials_” are used, which differ from “authentic” materials in that:
  - they are designed to have features that systematically scaffold learning, while
  - enabling engagement with meaningful and valued content.
- A promising approach is to use “_elaborated input_” that:
  - includes linguistic supports, such as:
    - redundancy, paraphrasing, synonyms, clear signaling, and marking to increase topic salience,
    - making the information flow chronologically,
    - using shorter sentences, etc;
  - follows instruction which includes frequent clarification requests and comprehension checks;
  - does not integrate childlike content, but remains interesting and relevant to adult learners’ knowledge development needs.

- Instruction occurs as tasks are performed.
- Instruction involves:
  - Gradually increasing the complexity of the communicative and conceptual demands of the tasks, while
  - Directing the learner’s attention to the language structures and tools.

## Language and Literacy Development of English Language Learners

- Compared with adult native speakers with low literacy, adult English language learners with low literacy show:
  - weaker vocabulary,
  - weaker passage comprehension,
  - weaker sight word reading skills, but
  - better phonological processing and
  - better phonological awareness.

- Recent findings from behavioral and neurobiological research imply that the **role of the primary language cannot be ignored** during the learning of a second language.
  - Multiple languages share brain structures and circuits, instead of having segregated ones.
  - Examples of such parallel activation across languages include:
      - In Dutch and English, “_room_” has different meanings (_it means “cream” in Dutch._) A Dutch-English bilingual will briefly (_and unconsciously_) activate both meanings of the word “_room_,” quickly choosing the one that is appropriate to the language being used.
      - Words that are pronounced differently in two languages (e.g., “_coin_” in French and English) produce interference in silent reading compared with words with very similar pronunciations (e.g., “_piano._”)
  - The degree of overlap depends on second language proficiency: individuals whose knowledge of the second language is relatively weak show greater activation of frontal regions (_reflecting more cognitive effort and use of working memory._)

- If certain skills and strategies are available to a learner in a first language, building on them may help to develop literacy in a second language.
  - Decoding skill in a first language supports decoding in a second language.
  - Good readers use similar comprehension strategies in both of their languages.
  - Vocabulary knowledge across the two languages of language learners is relatively independent.
  - Thus, there may be **possibilities for applying first-language knowledge and skills to the second language** when:
      - the literacy tasks involve analyzing language structure (phonology, morphology), or
      - when using metacognitive strategies.
  - The data suggest limited or no transfer, however, when the tasks involve language-specific patterns (e.g., orthographic rules for spelling, meanings of items.) An example: 
      - When college students who are highly literate in a first language are learning English:
      - Japanese and Chinese speakers rely on visual cues more than Korean or Persian speakers,
      - even though all four groups use non-Latin scripts:
      - because the latter two groups have a phonologically-based (_rather than morphemically-based_) writing system.

- The ability to **learn a second language declines with age**.
  - One theory proposes this capacity decreases because of neurodevelopmental processes, such as
    - dendritic proliferation and pruning, and
    - synapse elimination.
  - A second hypothesis is that plasticity declines because of success in learning a first language rather than brain development.
    - Learning a second language requires adjusting neural networks that support the first language.
    - Adjusting existing neural networks is very difficult, especially since those networks have been stabilized and are still successfully used in first language processing.
  - Age-related differences in working memory also may affect second language and literacy acquisition.
  - Another age-based trend: older readers tend to rely more on recognizing a whole word as a unit instead of decoding it using phonics skills.

## Directions for Future Research 

- In all `${quantitative research experiments that measure outcomes with standardized/researcher-developed tests}` to date, learner gains are small relative to the amount needed for someone to achieve proficiency required for functional literacy. A priority for research, then, is to experiment with a variety of ways to more **fully engage learners for longer periods of time,** to get the adults to participate and persevere.
  - We should develop and test approaches that have been used with some success to motivate adherence to health promotion programs (_e.g., weight loss, smoking cessation_).
  - Reminder systems used in health care may also prove of benefit.
  - Because effective literacy is built up over thousands of hours, it is extremely worthwhile to include out-of-class practice opportunities in any program.
  - Learners need help to set realistic goals and expectations: they can often underestimate the amount of practice and effort required to achieve fluency.
  - For adolescents and adults to invest the time required to develop their literacy, the instruction they receive must provide valued content knowledge and literacy skills.
      - To what degree is it possible for reading and writing instruction to piggyback onto instruction to develop content knowledge, instead of content knowledge being secondary to the acquisition of reading and writing skills?
      - Similarly, certain (technological) skills are in demand in the 21st century for social interaction and for success in college/work. To what extent can reading and writing skills be developed as part of developing these functional skills?
      - _Contextualized literacy instruction_ is an approach that is consistent with principles of learning.
          - Those whose goal it is to transition to training or postsecondary education mention the lack of focus on academic vocabulary in high beginning or intermediate classes.
          - A particular challenge is the need to differentiate instruction for adults in a classroom who vary in first language proficiency, educational background, and familiarity with U.S. culture.
          - An example: _The Integrated Basic Education and Skills Training_ program, or I-BEST, in Washington state is a program in which basic skills instructors and college-level career-technical faculty jointly design and teach college-level occupational courses for adult basic skills students.
              - I-BEST students (both adult basic education and ESL students) had better basic skills and the persistence to continue their education.
              - These students were not randomly assigned, however, but rather self-selected into I-BEST programs, so the results need to be interpreted cautiously.
      - Another tool to explore might be _anchored learning,_ examples of which include:
          - problem-based curricula in medical schools, in which students work on genuine medical cases, and
          - communities of practice, in which students try to solve problems of pollution in their city.
          - These formats are likely to motivate struggling adult learners who are sensitive to the value of their learning experience.
- An additional research priority is to develop **more valid ways of measuring adults’ literacy gains** with assessments normed for the population and designed to show progress in specific component skills.
  - Three types of assessment are needed: diagnostic, formative, and accountability assessment.
  - Currently, no satisfactory ways to comprehensively assess:
    - the range of literacy skills that adults bring to instruction, and
    - their growth over time.
  - The use of grade level equivalents needs to be rethought.
  - Assessments that involve selected or constrained responses (e.g., multiple choice or completion) show the largest effects of instruction because they match instruction closely.
  - Free response tasks that require spoken or written answers are better measures of learners’ second language proficiency, however, because they relate most closely to language use outside the classroom.
  - Technology also can assist with assessment, especially by leveraging recent model tracing, Bayesian network, and natural language processing advances.
- Another important direction for research in the next decade will be to **investigate the underlying cognitive, social, and cultural mechanisms involved in online reading, writing, and learning.**
  - What are the competencies involved in reading and writing online and comprehending and creating multimodal texts?
  - What instructional materials and programs are effective in developing digital literacy skills?
