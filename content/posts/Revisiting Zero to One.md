## What Are We Doing Here?

I’ll confess: my first read of “Zero to One” made me feel great about myself. Here was a public persona whose conduct I'd felt little but unease and mistrust for, and his book... well, I really liked it. 

I didn’t agree with the assumptions underlying a wide swath of it, to be clear. But I did learn a ton, thought about entire new topics for the first time, and (_if we're honest_) finished the book invigorated: even if, sure, in a kind of cheesy, young-pioneer, “_to seek, to strive, and not to yield!_” sort of way.

Even if the author himself was advocating teenagers avoid college, suing newspapers out of existence, and buying apocalypse-insurance in Hobbiton. So open-minded, Y!

And... that was that, for about a year and a half: even among the best of the genre, a little business/entrepreneurship-text goes along way.

## Revisitations

Reading through my notes, I’m somewhat perplexed that the author follows up “_no authority can prescribe in concrete terms how to be innovative_” with “_successful people find value in unexpected places... by thinking about business from first principles instead of formulas._” 

Perplexed, but pleased: “_approach issues from first principles_” sounds like a great, well, prescription (or... formula...) for me to apply. But I’m somewhat hazy on the meaning of that term. 

One [Wikipedia rabbithole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle) later (_mind the seductive digression into the [Cartesian doubt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_doubt) article!_), and my takeaway is that, generally, a "_first principle_" is a logical statement which can't be deduced from other statements. Which seems like a difficult station from which to depart, for your average train of thought.

But, you know, hell with it. Let’s give it a whirl, let’s start with a topic for which you already have a proclivity to overthink: learning! 

Deduction is cool, though, only when there’s not enough data for inductive reasoning: and on the topic of learning there's enough of a body of empirical research that it doesn't seem practical to start by hacking away at best practices like “_maybe repeat the skill you’re looking to pick up_” or “_how about you don’t \*start\* with the Beethoven sonatas._” 

The structures of our public institutions of learning, however, are largely coincidental and contingent: the products of either historical quirks, or scarcity of [_time, space, human-capital, capital-capital_], or both.

So, then: how _would_ you build the education system on a [generation ship?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_ship)

It’s only partially a glib question. The “year” is an arbitrary system of measurement derived from a now-distant star, so not only is the nine-month calendar no longer a requisite: but neither is sorting by that metric of age.

What impact do population sizes have: if the cohort of living, pre-adult colonists on the ship at a given time numbers, say, in the dozens, then does an extreme version of the German style aptitude-sorting become less distasteful?

And does such a system itself interact with a possible explosion of skills-complexity? Even with technological affordances, flying an interstellar ark is probably no mean feat: does the standard ceiling for mandatory education shift to somewhere in the early 20's, or even later? The questions multiply, cross-pollinate, and effloresce...


## Next Steps

Oh, man, this is exciting: a next-steps section to one of these "revisitation" posts that _doesn’t_ involve present-Y exhorting future-Y to build a proof-of-concept toy app that he’ll likely never get around to!

I mean, sure, instead it’s him making an exhortation to reimplement the foundations of what we know about learning, and teaching, and the administration of education systems.

But at least it’s not another `rails g scaffold foo`!
