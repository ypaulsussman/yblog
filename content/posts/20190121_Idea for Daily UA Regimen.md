## What Are We Doing Here?

To prevent linguistic attrition, I've been taking Ukrainian lessons on a video-tutoring platform.

My first homework was to read articles in Ukrainian. The amount of new vocabulary was overwhelming, so retention was poor. Moreover, the size (_and content richness!_) of the articles caused me to spend excessive focus on meaning, in the formal [Michael Long definition](https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/40789/1/Long%20(1998)_WP16(2).pdf).

I then began to translate instructor-constructed sentences. This enabled me to pay more attention to form-meaning interactions, but had serious downsides. 

Those sentences' language was often far outside the “_i + 1_”  optimal zone of complexity: I would translate low-frequency, accuracy-demanding collocations or idioms, but adopt and retain little of their features.

The difficulty in adoption was exacerbated by the limitations of written corrective-feedback. I couldn’t, for instance, synchronously confirm that a correction was due to an extrapolatable rule; nor could I propose several analogous samples to solidify my intuition of proper usage.

The difficulty in retention, too, was exacerbated by the inability to meaningfully return to any previous week’s homework: and, thus, to encode its contents in long-term memory.

## Where We're At

From those two tasks -- reading full articles with a focus on meaning, and translating idiomatic sentences with a focus on forms -- we've evolved the current system of homework. Currently, each week:

1. I write ~5-10 sentences in Ukrainian, along with (_I hope_) their English translations;
1. I email those sentences to my tutor;
1. I engage in a two-hour video lesson with my tutor, wherein:
    - We begin with free conversation.
        - The tutor verbally recasts incidentally-occurring errors, and requests learner self-correction;
        - The tutor verbally provides new, incidentally-discovered language;
        - Lexical items and morphosyntactic rules from either stream may be added to the chat-sidebar, at the tutor's discretion or learner's request.
    - We move to reviewing the homework's Ukrainian sentences.
        - The learner reads each sentence;
        - The tutor verbally elicits self-correction of sentence errors; 
        - The learner writes down the corrected sentences;
        - The tutor occasionally digresses to drill incidentally-occurring pronunciation.
    - We return to free conversation.
        - The learner attempts to weave earlier-encountered lexis, constructions, and errors into their speech;
        - The tutor does likewise: they both demonstrate correct usage and elicit it, via leading questions.
1. I add the corrected (_Ukrainian_) sentences to Anki, with the English translation as the flashcard-prompt.
1. I pay for the video lesson, and schedule the next one.
1. Each morning of the intervening week, I spend ~5min practicing all prior weeks' cards, per Anki's algorithm.
1. Returning to step 01, I build the coming week's ~5-10 sentences off 10-20 linguistic items from the lesson.

That ends up being around three hours a week: to me, that's a reasonable price for at least decelerating the loss of my Ukrainian skills.

## Where We Might Go

I see one weakness in my current system: it hinges on the interconnection between how people practice a language, and why they do.

Anecdotally, adult learners of foreign language (_that is, one not spoken in their current country_) are studying for one of two reasons.

The language may serve their business/academic/extrinsic interests. If so, the learner usually has both [1] a specific, falsifiable performance goal, and [2] a specific, falsifiable deadline. As such, they adhere to a rigorous learning schedule (_structured courses, an immersion program, etc._)

Alternatively, the language may serve personal/cultural/intrinsic interests. If so, the learner usually operates with neither a time constraint nor (_summative or formative_) performance benchmarks. With lower stakes, they're also at a greater risk of lapse due to quotidian interference.

I'm in the latter camp, currently: however, if my interests shifted into the former (_let's say that long-awaited faculty appointment to_ [_Ivan Franko_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Lviv) _came through! Or perhaps Zoe would take an unexpected interest in the preservation of the Eastern Carpathians..._) I don't know how I would accordingly accelerate my study-patterns.

I don't expect increasing the pace of memorization to be effective; that ignores the logic, and evidence-to-date, of spaced-repetition system (_"SRS"_) algorithms. 

Rather, I would supplement it with parallel, cross-referential exercises: three video sessions a week, each with a separate homework-lesson cycle.

## Next Steps

The convenience of my ongoing cycle comes at the expense of extended discourse. I think that's reasonable: I recently reviewed the transcription from an early assignment, one in which I spent ~90 minutes decoding, transcribing, and translating a three-minute documentary clip.  I’ve retained no lexis, or grammar constructs, presented in that exercise. 

Language structures, however, are hardly the only metric for evaluating an exercise. The four macroskills (_reading, writing, listening, speaking_) are harder to measure progress in: at least partially _because_ of that difficulty, however, I'd argue those skills are still-more important to ensure exercises for. 

Below are two such cycles: alternative weekly-exercise systems that prioritize macroskills. For efficiency, they each switch message-channels across performative modes: the first exercise provides written input, then elicits verbal output; the second does the opposite.

### Exercise 01: Interview Transcripts

For earlier homework, I read interview excerpts from [The Ukrainians](https://theukrainians.org/category/interview/); prior to that, I'd read [news articles](https://www.bbc.com/ukrainian).

Both provide opportunitites to learn multi-sentence compositional techniques, but for a couple reasons I typically preferred the former. 

Transcribed interviews provide a combination of written and spoken discourse: natural speech, but polished by an editor. Their Q&A format delimits blocks of text that -- while they also connect to form a logical whole -- remain easily apprehensible in smaller chunks (_unlike, frequently, a news report's paragraphs._)

Finally, I found the interviews provided a wider range of of rhetorical styles, as well: not solely descriptive or narrative, but also argumentative or instructional. For maximal diversity, though, I would aim to use both sites.

**A weekly sequence:**
1. Video tutor (_"VT"_) selects an (L2) interview, sends its link, and drafts ~5 thematically-related questions;
1. Student (_"ST"_) reads the interview;
1. [_Optional_] ST rephrases/expands ~5 questions from the interview;
1. [_Optional_] ST records themselves reading their questions;
1. ST receives [_Optional: exchanges_] questions from/with VT;
1. ST records answers to the VT's questions, without written preparation or rerecordings;
1. ST sends [_Optional: exchanges_] video of answers to/with VT, 
1. In weekly session, VT and ST review ST's mistakes;
1. Following the session, ST re-records answers;
1. Following the session, ST enters any errors generated by question/answer-creation into SRS.

### Exercise 02: Long-Form Listen
As another earlier exercise, I transcribed short videos, often news reports or documentary excerpts. 

Unfortunately, even the shortest clips demanded heroic effort to transcribe and translate; there was little time to practice listening for the extraction and creation of meaning. (_This is perhaps a greater indictment of my Ukrainian than the exercise._)

Many language-pedagogy texts that I've encountered discuss how, in listening exercises, questions that elicit [bottom-up processing](https://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/article/bottom) have historically been underemphasized. I freely admit the following sequence does little to help. 

This is deliberate, if irksome. It's an acknowledgment that, to create tasks that require a learner to parse an audio text from its smallest units (_i.e. phonetic > phonemic > syllabic > lexical > syntactic features, etc_), one needs both [1] a background in the linguistic structures of the L2, and [2] sufficient time to analyze the text.

And that's a pretty serious demand from a VT. Even asking for 3-5 contextual, inference-based, semantics-focused questions from a native speaker with some-to-no-training in language teaching is a lot, given the schedule! 

As such, I've focused below solely on top-down listening.

**A weekly sequence:**
  1. VT selects a short (_~2-5min?_) clip, and drafts ~5 comprehension-questions in L2;
  1. VT sends ST both the link to the clip and the questions;
  1. ST listens to clip, and writes answers in L2;
  1. ST writes short (_~5-10 sentence?_) review of the clip, discussing any of the following prompts:
    ```
    - What did you already know about the topic before you read this?
    - What did this remind you of?
    - What new things did you learn?
    - What questions do you still have?
    ```
  5. ST sends their answers and review to VT; 
  5. VT provides written corrective feedback;
  5. ST corrects their answers/review and resubmits to VT;
  5. In weekly session, they discuss any extant mistakes;
  5. Following the session, the ST extracts selected erroneous sentences to SRS.
