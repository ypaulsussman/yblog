Technology is miraculous because it allows us to do more with less, ratcheting up our fundamental capabilities to a higher level.

The paradox of teaching entrepreneurship is that such a formula necessarily cannot exist.
- Because every innovation is new and unique, no authority can prescribe in concrete terms how to be innovative.
- Successful people find value in unexpected places and they do this by thinking about business from first principles instead of formulas.

“What important truth do very few people agree with you on?”
- It’s intellectually difficult because the knowledge that everyone is taught in school is by definition agreed-upon.
- It’s psychologically difficult because anyone trying to answer must say something she knows to be unpopular.
- But... if you can identify a delusional popular belief, you can find what lies behind it: the contrarian truth.

Startups operate on the principle that you need to work with other people to get stuff done, but you also need to stay small enough so that you actually can.

The first step thinking clearly is to question what we think we know about the past.

Four big lessons from the dot-com crash... still guide business thinking today:
1.  Make incremental advances
2.  Stay lean and flexible
3.  Improve on the competition
4.  Focus on product, not sales

And yet the opposite principles are probably more correct:
1.  It is better to risk boldness than triviality.
2.  A bad plan is better than no plan.
3.  Competitive markets destroy profits.
4.  Sales matters just as much as product.

Creating value is not enough—you also need to capture some of the value you create.
- Capitalism is premised on the accumulation of capital, but under perfect competition all profits get competed away.
- Monopolists lie to protect themselves. They tend to do whatever they can to conceal their monopoly—usually by exaggerating the power of their (nonexistent) competition.
- Non-monopolists tell the opposite lie.
    - Entrepreneurs are always biased to understate the scale of competition... the fatal temptation is to describe your market extremely narrowly so that you dominate it by definition.
    - If you lose sight of competitive reality and focus on trivial differentiating factors... Your business is unlikely to survive.

In a static world, a monopolist is just a rent collector. But the world we live in is dynamic: it’s possible to invent new and better things.
- Monopolies drive progress because the promise of years or even decades of monopoly profits provides a powerful incentive to innovate.
- Then monopolies can keep innovating because profits enable them to make the long-term plans and finance the ambitious research projects the firms locked in competition can’t dream of.

War is costly business.
- Rivalry causes us to overemphasize old opportunities and slavishly copy what has worked in the past.
- Winning is better than losing, but everybody loses win the war isn’t one worth fighting.

A great business is defined by its ability to generate cash flows in the future.
- Simply stated, the value of business today is the sum of all the money it will make in the future. (To properly evaluate a business, you also have to discount those future cash flows to their present worth, since a given amount of money today is worth more than the same amount in the future.)
- For a company to be valuable it must grow and endure, but most entrepreneurs focus only on short-term growth.
    - They have an excuse: growth is easy to measure, but durability isn’t.
    - If you focus on near-term growth above all else, you miss the most important question you should be asking: will this business still be around a decade from now?

Every monopoly is unique, but they usually share some combination of the following characteristics: proprietary technology, network effects, economies of scale, and branding.
- Proprietary technology is the most substantive advantage a company can have because it makes your product difficult or impossible to replicate.
    - As a good rule of thumb, proprietary technology must be at least 10 times better than its closest substitute in some important dimension.
    - The clearest way to make a 10x improvement is to invent something completely new.
- Network effects can be powerful, but:
    - you’ll never reap them unless your product is valuable to its very first users when the network is necessarily small.
    - Paradoxically, then, network-effects businesses must start with especially small markets.
- A monopoly business gets stronger as it gets bigger: the fixed cost of creating a product (engineering, management, office space) can be spread out over ever-greater quantities of sales.
    - Service businesses especially are difficult to make monopolies.
    - A good startup should have the potential for great scale build into its first design.
- A company has a monopoly on its own brand by definition, so creating a strong brand is a powerful way to claim a monopoly.
    - Beginning with brand rather than substance is dangerous.

Every startup is small at the start. Every monopoly dominates a large share of its market. Therefore, every startup should start with a very small market.
- The reason is simple: it’s easier to dominate a small market than a large one.
- The perfect target market for a startup is a small group of particular people concentrated together and served by few or no competitors.
- Once you create and dominate a niche market, then you should gradually expand into related and slightly broader markets. Sequencing markets correctly is underrated, and it takes discipline to expand gradually.

Originally, “disruption” was a term of art to describe how a firm can:
- use new technology to introduce a low-end product at low prices,
- improve the product over time, and eventually
- overtake even the premium products offered by encumbered companies using older technology.

But if you truly want to make something new, the act of creation is far more important than the old industries that might not like what you create. 
- Indeed, if your company can be summed up by its opposition to already existing firms, you can’t be completely new and it’s probably not going to become a monopoly. 
- As you craft a plan to expand to adjacent markets, don’t disrupt: avoid competition as much as possible.

A conventional truth can be important - it's essential to learn elementary mathematics, for example - but it will not give you an edge. It’s not a secret.

Why has so much of our society come to believe that there are no hard secrets left?
- From an early age, we are taught that the right way to do things is to proceed with a very small step at a time (_incrementalism._)
- People are scared of secrets because they are scared of being wrong. By definition, a secret hasn’t been vetted by the mainstream (_risk aversion._)
- Social elites have the most freedom and ability to explore new thinking, but they seem to believe in secrets in the least. Why search for a new secret if you can comfortably collect rents on top of everything that has already been done? (_complacency._)
- As globalization advances, people perceive the world is one homogenous, highly competitive marketplace... If it were possible to discover something new, wouldn’t someone from the faceless global talent pool of smarter and more creative people have found it already? (_“Flatness.”_)

There’s an optimistic way to describe the result of these trends: today, you can’t start a cult. Very few people take unorthodox ideas seriously today ...yet that gain has come at a great cost: we have given up our sense of wonder at secrets left to be discovered.

The best entrepreneurs know this: every great business is built around a secret that’s hidden from the outside. A great company is a conspiracy to change the world.

When thinking about what kind of company to build, there are two distinct questions to ask:

- What secrets is nature not telling you?
- What secrets are people not telling you? (_Secrets about people are relatively underappreciated._)

The best place to look for secrets is where no one else is looking. Are there any fields that matter but haven’t been standardized and institutionalized?

When you start something, the first and most crucial decision you make is whom you started with.
- It’s unromantic to think soberly about what could go wrong, so most people don’t.
- Technical abilities and complementary skill sets matter, but how well the founders know each other and how well they work together matter just as much.

It’s not just founders who need to get along. Everyone in your company needs to work well together.... It’s useful to distinguish between three concepts:
1.  Ownership: who legally owns a company’s equity (typically allocated among founders, employees, and investors)
2.  Possession: who actually runs the company on a day-to-day basis (the managers and employees)
3.  Control: who formally governs the company’s affairs (Board of Directors, usually comprising founders and investors)

In practice, distributing these functions among different people makes sense, but it also multiplies opportunities for misalignment.

In the boardroom, less is more. A board of three is ideal. Your board should never exceed five people, unless your company is publicly held.

As a general rule, everyone you involved with your company should be involved full-time.
- Sometimes you’ll have to break this: e.g. hire outside lawyers and accountants.
- Anyone who doesn’t own stock options or draw a regular salary from your company is fundamentally misaligned....they’ll be biased to claim value in the near-term, not help you create more in the future.
    - That’s why hiring consultants doesn’t work.
    - Part-time employees don’t work.
    - Even working remotely should be avoided.

A company does better the less it pays the CEO.
- Low CEO pay also set the standard for everyone else.
- If a CEO doesn’t set an example by taking the lowest salary in the company, he can do the same thing by taking the highest salary. So long as that figure is still modest, it sets an effective ceiling on cash compensation.

Equity is the one form of compensation that can effectively orient people toward creating value in the future.
- However, for equity to create commitment rather than conflict, you must allocate it very carefully.
- Since it’s impossible to achieve perfect fairness when distributing ownership, founders would do well to keep the details secret.

“Company culture” doesn’t exist apart from the company itself: no company \*has\* a culture; every company \*is\* a culture. A startup is a team of people on a mission, and a good culture is just what that looks like on the inside.

Since time is your most valuable asset, it’s odd to spend it working with people who don’t envision any long-term future together. If you can’t count durable relationships among the fruits of your time at work, you haven't invested your time well—even in purely financial terms.

Why would someone join your company as its 20th engineer when she could go work at Google for more money and more prestige? There are two general kinds of good answers:
- Explain why your mission is compelling: not why it’s important in general, but why you're doing something important that no one else is going to get done.
- You should (also) be able to explain why your company is a unique match for him personally.
- Above all, don’t fight the perk war.

Startups should make their early staff as _personally_ similar as possible. Startups have a limited resources and small teams. They must work quickly and efficiently in order to survive, and that’s easier to do when everyone shares an understanding of the world.

The best thing I did as a manager at PayPal was to make every person in the company responsible for doing just one thing.
- Every employee’s one thing was unique, and everyone knew I would evaluate him only on that one thing.
- Defining roles reduced conflict. Most fights inside a company happen when colleagues compete for the same responsibilities.

Distribution may not matter in fictional worlds, but it matters in ours.
- We underestimate the importance of distribution—a catchall term for everything it takes to sell a product—but customers will not come just because you build it. You have to make that happen and it’s harder than it looks.
- All salesmen are actors: their priority is persuasion, not sincerity. Like acting, sales works best when hidden. This explains why almost everyone whose job involves distribution has a job title that has nothing to do with those things.
- Thus, the most fundamental reason that even businesspeople underestimate the importance of sales is the systematic effort to hide it at every level of every field in the world secretly driven by it.

Think of distribution as something essential to the design of your product. If you’ve invented something new but you haven’t invented it effective way to sell it, you have a bad business—no matter how good the product.

The total net profit that you earn over the course of your relationship with the customer (customer lifetime value) must exceed the amount you spend to acquire a new customer (customer acquisition cost.)

The kitchen sink approach—employ a few salespeople, places some magazine ads, and try to add some kind of viral functionality to the product as an afterthought—doesn’t work. Most businesses get zero distribution channels to work: poor sales rather than bad product is the most common cause of failure. If you can get just one distribution channel to work, you have a great business. If you try for several but don’t nail one, you’re finished.

...computers are complements for humans, not substitutes. The most valuable businesses of coming decades will be built by entrepreneurs who seek to empower people rather than try to make them obsolete.

Seven questions that every business must answer:

1.  The engineering question
    1.  Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements?
    1.  Companies must strive for 10x better because merely incremental improvements often end up meaning no improvement at all for the end user.
1.  The timing question
    1.  Is now the right time to start your particular business?
    1.  Entering a slow-moving market can be a good strategy, but only if you have a definite in a realistic plan to take it over.
1.  The monopoly question
    1.  Are you starting with a big share of a small market?
    1.  Customers won’t care about any particular technology unless it solves a particular problem in a superior way. And if you can’t monopolize a unique solution for a small market, you’ll be stuck with the vicious competition.
1.  The people question
    1.  Do you have the right team?
1.  The distribution question
    1.  Do you have a way to not just create but to deliver your product?
1.  The durability question
    1.  Will your market to be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future?
    1.  What will stop competitors X, Y, Z from wiping out your business?
1.  The secret question
    1.  Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don’t see?
    1.  Don’t describe your bright future using broad conventions on which everyone agrees. Great companies have secrets: specific reasons for success that other people don’t see.

Progress isn’t held back by some difference between corporate greed and nonprofit goodness; instead we are held back by the sameness of both. Just as corporations tends to copy each other, nonprofits all tend to push the same priorities.

A valuable business must start by finding a niche and dominating a small market.
