### [A Blogging Style Guide (Robert Heaton)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18626098)

- There's nothing wrong with a good old fashioned listicle when you have a collection of points you'd like to make but not the energy or ability to elegantly tie them together.
- Make a list of words and phrases you'd like to avoid.
- Unless you have a good reason for swearing, you might as well not.
- A light extended metaphor can help your reader remember an idea, even if they didn't need the metaphor in order to understand it.
- Your post should... work without hyperlinks. It's useful to include them for... context, but lazy and unhelpful to rely on them.
- Follow (at the very least) [GitHub's accessibility guidelines.](https://styleguide.github.com/primer/principles/accessibility/)
- Don't bury the lede... Prefer to instead state a conclusion, then demonstrate why it is true.
- [_Staring into space is fine, but it's_] better to spend that 30 minutes spamming down any old nonsense that you can refine later, or that at least helps get you mentally unblocked.


### [10 years of professional blogging - what I've learned](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15954648)

- write [_your article's title_] as the very last thing. It has to be a compelling opinion or important learning
    - [_can be_] a factoid (like push notifs being 40%+ CTR) that’s fascinating and shareable
    - avoid vague titles like “Here are my thoughts on XYZ.”
- Think of your writing on the same timescale as your career. Write on a multi-decade timeframe.
- Focus on writing freq over anything else. Schedule it.
- Most of my writing comes from talking/reading deciding I strongly agree or disagree. These opinions become titles. Titles become essays.
- [_Even if the topic is saturated with content_] knowledge can be shared via video, long-form essays, podcasts, presentation decks, etc. Even when there are experts writing long-form content about cryptocurrencies, let’s say, there’s still room in the market for a highly visual version.
- Speaking at conferences is the worst time suck. You spend hours prepping a deck, speak to a group of perhaps a few hundred people, and retain very few them in any meaningful relationship. It can feel good to be recognized, but at the same time, it just can’t compare to writing a piece of content that lives forever.
