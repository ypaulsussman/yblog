## What Are We Doing Here?

I've included this section in every prior post, but haven't got much to say, here: the book looked interesting, and the library-price was right, so... I read the NYT articles that it compiled, and took notes.

And several months later, I reread those notes -- and here we are!

## Revisitation

The article I valued most was [The Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition's experiment](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/CABN.2.2.89): they used progressively less-exaggerated minimal pairs to train the `/r/` and `/l/` phonemes among L1-Japanese speakers. 

Or, rather, I valued the study's promising results: I still love me a pedagogical breakthrough, even one for merely a subset (_phonemic inventory_) of a linguistic structure (_pronunciation._)

Alas, that’s not really what the research indicates. The Times article that this book excerpts, "[_Old Brains Can Learn New Language Tricks_](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/20/science/old-brains-can-learn-new-language-tricks.html)," was published in 1999; the the experiment's closest associated article was published in 2002. 

That paper focuses less on a pedagogical intervention, and more on identifying empirical evidence for [connectionist](http://cnbc.cmu.edu/~plaut/IntroPDP/papers/Rogers09chap.connModels.pdf) [neural](http://www.mind.ilstu.edu/curriculum/connectionism_intro/connectionism_1.php) [models](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/connectionism/) of acoustic-processing acquisition. 

Even the passage allocated to learner outcomes within the "Discussion" section reports tepid results:

> _Without feedback, 3 days of adaptive training produced substantial improvements, but 3 days of fixed training produced no benefit relative to control... With feedback, both fixed and adaptive training led to robust improvements, and the benefit of training transferred to a second continuum (e.g.,_ road–load _)._

> _In contrast to the fixed training condition without feedback, fixed training with feedback produced very robust learning. Indeed, the subjects in this condition showed learning as good as and, by some measures, slightly better than the subjects who received adaptive training with feedback._

> _...our finding that feedback does make a very large difference... makes it clear that Hebb’s idea about the basis of changes in the strengths of connections between neurons does not provide a full account of the factors that influence perceptual learning._

That sounds like a validation of using corrective feedback in pronunciation practice: the second-language acquisition (SLA) equivalent of a null hypothesis. 

As if to underline that judgment, the 2002 article was cited (_but, perhaps irrelevantly, not included for review_) in a [2017 meta-analysis of perception-training research](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0142716417000418).

That meta-analysis concludes that: 

> _(a) perception-only training leads to small-sized production gains;_

> _(b) there is a small to medium, not statistically significant relationship between perception gains and production gains;_

> _(c) production gains are larger for obstruents than for vowels or sonorants; and_

> _(d) there are five features of perception-only training that likely encourage larger production gains: second language contexts, beginner-level of L2 experience, training at home, a short training, and the existence of phonetic instruction._

I feel comfortable inferring that the SLA's research priorities have broadly moved on from what that 2002 paper referred to as “_adaptive training._”

I'll admit: I'm somewhat crestfallen by this exploration's arc from “_1999 article in respected newspaper proclaiming language-teaching tactic with outsize benefits_“ to “_2017 meta-analysis dismissing that tactic out of hand._“

Simultaneously, though, I can’t help but be grateful, even somewhat humbled, at the abundance of free, convenient, quality data available to me online. The above arc took me perhaps 90 minutes -- even two decades ago, it'd have been unthinkably longer.

Now, context switch! _Apropos_ nothing, said arc of exploration was punctuated by a second, far briefer reflection. 

I also learned that, modulo a five-century sidetrip as a semi-pictorial script, the first human writing coevolved with the first lists and categorization systems (_for use in agrarian-economic administration - thanks, Sumeria!_)

Given how visually-oriented we are as a species, I wonder if other examples could be teased out of history, other cases where new models of thought coevolved with new models of graphical representation? 

The relationship between, well, [_inductive logic, mass usage of statistics, “thinking probabilistically”_] and [_charts, plots, and other data-visualization_] first comes to mind: time to more-deeply explore the [Tufte collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte), then.

I think the most interesting question, though, would be: "_what paradigms or frameworks for thinking are_ currently _emergent? And what visual tools are they coevolving with?_"

## Next Steps

The first reflection appears to confirm the [metallic laws of evaluation](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/rossis-rules)'s relevance to SLA. As a thought-experiment, run `s/social program/pedagogical intervention` on that doc: would the widespread promulgation of ensuing rules alter what SLA research-topics receive funding? What classroom-practices companies build tools to promote? Take 30 minutes, and make an explicit list.

...but beyond that, not much. This was a fun read, and equally enjoyable on review of my notes: but I don’t see any projects percolating forth. (_Other than, perhaps, "steal and read your spouse's grad-school data-visualization books."_)
