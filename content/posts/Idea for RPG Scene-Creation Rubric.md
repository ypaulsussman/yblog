## Metacommentary

I've collected 29 documents containing notes from [books I've read, lectures I’ve watched, workshops I've attended, etc], and 20 bullet-point ideas that percolated up from, well, unanticipated nerve firings.

My plan is to traverse that list of 49 prompts over the coming weeks, re-engaging with old notes to see what pith time has sifted out of them, and reexamining old ideas to see if there's anything that merits scavenging or extrapolating.

Randomizing that list, the following was the first prompt to come up: conveniently, it's also one that I've been thinking over recently (as work makes the near-future prospects of a good RPG campaign appear dimmer and dimmer.)

## Dungeons, Dragons, Printers, Presses

My experience: the “sentence > paragraph > chapter” model of prose organization for a GM's adventure notes...

1. facilitates the DM’s _ad lib_ reading (and rereading) of the adventure, while alone; and
1. hinders the DM's realtime lookup and reference, while playing the game.

I doubt this is the oversight of (two Generations, now?!) of writers, editors, and designers. Indeed, this may well have been noted by publishers, already, but left unaddressed for very practical reasons of

- publishing (_modulo the advent of e.g. InDesign, I presume it's still easier to release at cost and on a tight schedule by adhering to centuries-old methods of typesetting and page organization_), or
- sales. (_Personal, dismal anecdata lead me to feel comfortable predicting the difference between_ [the number of a given RPG book sold and the number read] _to be fraction of the difference between_ [the number sold and the number used to actually play an adventure].)

And perhaps even delight! If we accept that discrepancy in ratios, then what **is** the harm in designing adventures that are meant to be read, foremost, and played out of second? What’s the downside in conceiving of "adventure module" as a subgenre within that of "prose writing," one is that the purchaser could, (_should they so wish, as an afterthought_) use as the skeleton of a game they play with friends?

The downside is that I write crappy prose, even when I spend energy on it. And I don’t like spending energy!

Writing words that intuitively connect to form the sentence, sentences that compose a greater paragraph, and paragraphs that build toward a unified whole of a passage? Yeah, that’s arduous for me -- and note we're just discussing the process of adhering to a structure. This presupposes that one is a font of unimprovable events, scenes, NPCs, treasures. Font of many things, I may be: but I’ve yet to find myself ejecting good ideas regularly.

More fundamentally, I don't think of [_the notes I construct to help myself DM a game_] as similar, structurally, to [_the essays I wrote in college, or fiction I wrote in high school_]. I'm not looking for the Grammarly or writing-center tutor of RPG-module writing. If anything, my adventures' closest architectural cousin would be the codebases I pick through at work. 

What I suspect I need, then, is a tool that facilitates my style of preparing a game session: [an IDE](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/21092) for writing adventures. 

And, while the debugging and Intellisense and code highlighting are all lovely? The thing my lazy self cherishes the most is probably code completion. Being able to type `'de' + Enter` and have an entire `describe` block appear? Wonderful. Adding a component to your `render` method and having its `import` statement automagically appear at the top of the file? Magic. Combine that with with the the guard-rails [provided by a good checklist](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122226184), and I _think_ my adventure-planning productivity would take off. 

## The Skeleton of a Scene

And that’s what I’ve created the following rubric for: to scaffold my writing of a given unit of PC exploration. 

The goal is to prevent the busy DM from forgetting to sketch out any crucial component of a particular scene: but to demarcate each of those divisions such that they can be connected in a graph of [time, location, or causality], to compose a full adventure. (_For thinking through that higher-order organization, I'll need another post._)

A scene should contain:

1. **Entry Parameters**
    * List ways in which the initial scene may be altered by...
        * Where the PCs enter (_through which access point_); 
        * When the PCs enter (_what time of day, how soon after a prior event_); 
        * How the PCs enter (_what they look like, what they say on arrival to any guards or observers_); 
        * With whom the PCs enter; 
        * What they are carrying as they enter.
    * Use these parameters to reward PC planning, and to give weight to the outcomes of previous scenes. 

1. **Scene Description**
    * List... 
        * The environment: surroundings, weather, temperature, background sounds, smells, _in media res_ events 
        * Non-player characters: what they're wearing, what they're doing, what emotions/conditions they're visibly emiting  
        * Interactable objects: highlight anything characters may want to explore further, take for themselves, or use within the scene
    * Always include at least one background detail that the discerning player can take advantage of, or infer some clue from.

1. **Player Choices**
    * There may be several of these in a scene, but there must be at least one.
    * Each choice should be listed as "required" or "optional" (_that is, whether the scene can end before the PCs have made a decision).
    * Each choice may include:
        * Any preconditions for them to be able to be offered the choice; 
        * Any challenges arising from their choice (_dice rolls, resource expenditures_); 
    * Each choice must include: 
        * Consequences of the different choices the PC's could take.

1. **Independent Events**
    * These are optional to a scene; there may be none.
    * These include NPC actions that will occur regardless of the PC's behavior, or developments that take place on a countdown from PC entry to the scene.

1. **Exit Clause** 
    * Under what circumstances the scene will end.
    * Examples: a certain length of time elapsing, or the PC's concluding a decision or challenge.
    
## Next Steps

And there we go! I'm curious to experience the usage of this rubric in both more narratively-driven, crunch-light systems (_VTM jumps to mind, foremostly_) and systems with a greater focus on clear divisions between round-, minute-, and hour-based timing (_I'm thinking, initially at least, of 5e._) Someday...

As a side note: if you were to turn this (_with, necessarily, a suite of other tools_) into a full-fledged browser-based subscription service to help DM's shape their own campaigns? You'd be missing a beat not to title the product "DMWare."
