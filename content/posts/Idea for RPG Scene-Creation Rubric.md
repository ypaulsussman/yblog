## Dungeons, Dragons, Printers, Presses

Most RPG modules adventures are written in the standard model of prose: sentences become paragraphs, paragraphs become chapters, chapters become books.

In my experience, this structure does two things:

- it makes it easy for the DM to read through the adventure, on their own;
- makes it difficult for the DM to perform quick lookups, in realtime gameplay.

I doubt this is an oversight of (_two generations, now?_) of RPG writers and editors. Indeed, this likely **has** already been noticed: and left unaddressed, for practical reasons.

- _pace_ e.g. InDesign, it's easier (_thus cheaper_) to design books that adhere to a preexisting, centuries-old layout.
- it's anecdata-based, but: far more RPG modules are purchased than are played. (_The gap between modules-purchased and modules-read is much smaller._)

If we accept that discrepancy in ratios, then what **is** the downside to adventures that are foremostly designed to be read, with ease-of-reference an afterthought?

For publishers, nothing. We basement-DM's unconstrained by market-demand, however, should recognize the formal-liberty open to us, and experiment more broadly, and more frequently, with the structure of adventure-documentation.

## Ed Greenwood's IntelliJ

Mentally, I don't structure the flow of an adventure the same way I structure an argument, or a description. It follows that the DM-notes I prep bear little resemblance to posts I add here, or to the essays I wrote in school.

The closest architectural cousin I can imagine is a codebase: the lattice of recursing paths, transformations and returns, if-checks and break-clauses.

What I would want, then, is effectively [an IDE](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/21092) for drafting adventures.

While jump-to-definition, clickable breakpoints, and code-highlighting are valuable, I think I cherish [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense) the most.

## Like Clippy, But for Killing PC's

And thatâ€™s the behavior I want this rubric to replicate: to predictively offer up constrained lists, thereby scaffolding the generation of content. (_"Content" of course here meaning "details of a given encounter," rather than e.g. "objects and lambdas."_)

As a DM, I'd like each of my session's encounters to have the following described:

1. **Entry Parameters**

   - List ways in which the initial scene may be altered by...
      - Where the PCs enter (_through which access point_)
      - When the PCs enter (_what time of day, how soon after a prior event_)
      - How the PCs enter (_what they look like, what they say on arrival to any guards or observers_)
      - With whom the PCs enter
      - What they are carrying as they enter
   - Use these parameters to reward PC planning, and to give weight to the outcomes of previous encounters.

1. **Location Description**

   - List...
      - The environment: surroundings, weather, temperature, background sounds, smells, _in media res_ events
      - Non-player characters: what they're wearing, what they're doing, what emotions/conditions they're visibly emiting
      - Interactable objects: highlight anything characters may want to explore further, take for themselves, or use within the encounter
   - Always include at least one background detail that the discerning player can take advantage of, or infer some clue from.

1. **Player Decisions**

   - There may be several of these in a scene, but there must be at least one
   - Each decision should be listed as "required" or "optional" (_that is, whether the scene can end before the PCs have made a decision_)
   - Each decision may include:
      - Any preconditions for them to be offered the decision
      - Any challenges arising from their choice (_dice rolls, resource expenditures_)
   - Each decision must describe the consequences for each of the choices the PC's could take.

1. **Independent Events**

   - These are optional to an encounter; there may be none.
   - These include NPC actions that will occur regardless of the PC's behavior, or developments that take place on a countdown from PC entry to the scene.

1. **Exit Conditions**

   - Under what circumstances the encounter will end.
   - Examples: a certain length of time elapsing, or the PC's concluding a decision or challenge.

## Next Steps

For this post, merely two research questions:

I'd be curious to examine how this rubric works in more narratively-driven, crunch-light systems (_the various WoD games jump to mind, foremostly_), versus systems with a more-granular focus on the divisions between round-, minute-, hour-, etc-based timing (_I'm thinking, initially at least, of 3e/4e/5e._)

I'd be curious, too, about what sort of patterns would emerge from user-generated content, were this to [1] be offered as a free web app, and [2] gain any sort of popularity.
