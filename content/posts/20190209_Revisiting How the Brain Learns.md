## What Are We Doing Here?

Each time I visit my notes on some text about the neuroscience of learning, or the evolution of language, or the cutting edge of classroom research... that process is haunted, quietly, by a shadow of superfluousness.

It's never fun to watch ingenuous, frustrated students expend egregious hours and effort to learn, betrayed and hamstrung all the while by poor teaching practice.

I foremostly recall English-language learners in the post-Soviet education system (_from Peace Corps Ukraine, where our teacher-counterparts were often inculcated with a mechanized, punitive, empirically-refuted methodology_); however, the vision applies equally to many ESL/ABE classrooms I’ve attended across the United States (_where teachers, usually volunteers, were simply not trained in_ any _pedagogical practice, correct or no._)

And, in reality, it's rarely the case that available time and student energy are limitless; humans are fragile and society's turbulent. But even if it were -- even if the only barrier to optimal learner uptake were the succcessful _implementation_ of preexisting teaching and learning best-practices -- that's not what I care for, apparently. It's certainly not what I read about.

I’ve turned this over, again and again: is it even valuable, in 2019, to focus on the boundaries of what we know about learning? Or is it far more beneficial to focus on the boundaries of _how we promulgate_ what we already know about learning? How would we even calculate, let alone measure, their respective societal value?

I'm resigned to fall back on selfishness: the newest insights into how humans learn, and into leveraging them via content and curriculum... they interest me. They have the flavor to draw me away from the cinema, or the park, or the barstool. But the rough, hard work of how to spread them more evenly across society? That... doesn't.

I disregard lived experience, the visceral anecdata from my own classrooms, conferences, offices, all in order that my impulsive brain can get one more hit from the excitement of reading pure research. That promise of the silver bullet in the beaker: that's what lights it up; that's what it myopically finds engaging.

Man, the end of winter gets _dark!_ Love you, Minnesota...

## Revisiting Your Actual Notes

Helpfully, I'd made reference to “_massed practice_” (in contrast to “_distributed practice_”) without having defined either.

While charmed by past-self's faith in present-self's ability to recognize terminology, I needed to DDG `${term} !g site:.edu` to define them succinctly enough for future-self's reference. (_TL;DR: former is cramming; latter is SRS._)

Along the way, I encountered the following from "_Distributed Practice in Verbal Recall Tasks: A Review and Quantitative Synthesis_" (Cepeda et al, 2006):

> ...spaced (vs. massed) learning of items consistently shows benefits regardless of retention interval, and learning benefits increase with increased time lags between learning presentations... [but] once the interval between learning sessions reaches some relatively long amount of time, further increases either have no effect upon or decrease memory as measured in a later test. The magnitude of the observed distributed practice benefit depends on the joint effects of [interstudy interval] and retention interval; retention interval influences the peak of this function.
> Distributing learning across different days (instead of grouping learning episodes within a single day) greatly improves the amount of material retained for sizable periods of time; the literature clearly suggests that distributing practice in this way is likely to markedly improve students’ retention of course material.

So spaced-repetition is important: and within that, it's not merely the _repetition-quality_ that matters, but the _spacing-quality_ as well. Build them Leitner boxes, vary their intervals, and test the results.

But this article is over a decade old and, for all I know, largely unread. Checking its citation count on Google Scholar led me to [_Visible Learning_](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781134024124), a synthesis of "_over 800 meta-analyses on the influences on achievement in school-aged students._"

I meandered down several contradictory reviews of the book: [_The Economist_ cites its conclusions](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2016/06/11/teaching-the-teachers) as implicitly valid, while researchers from both [the institutional](https://robertslavinsblog.wordpress.com/2018/06/21/john-hattie-is-wrong/) and [the computational](https://academiccomputing.wordpress.com/2013/08/05/book-review-visible-learning/) spheres of education have similar and considerable issues with his methodology. And that was exciting, for several (_...dozen_) minutes!

It ended, however, with an abrupt interjection of those pangs from my above "_What Are We Doing Here?_"

When, as that _Economist_ piece lays out, the problems lie more in best-practice dissemination than identification... well, wouldn't the former be the target to engage? What could be my next steps t-

And at _that_ moment, I was reminded of what prompted this exploration in the first place. Here's the note I'd written so many months prior, the one that set the above digression off:

> Effective practice starts with massed practice (_for fast learning_) and proceeds to distributed practice later for retention: thus each test should not only query new material, but also allow students to practice important older content.

That offhand mention of the value of _massed_ practice -- and immediately, I was off. Had there been studies comparing

- the effects of a spaced-repetition system wherein the first encounter with the new content is "massed"
with
- the effects of a spaced-repetition system wherein the first encounter is _not_ significantly longer or more repetitive than future encounters?

What other variables might weaken or strengthen retrieval? Lengthen or contract the encounter-interval? Back to gScholar, then, and after to-

Sigh. Dogs, and tricks; leopards, and spots.

## Next Steps

One step toward better-braiding these two threads (_classroom best-practice identification, and classroom best-practice implementation_) could be to compare where they most visibly diverge.

In what subfields do people’s beliefs about teaching and learning most wildly diverge from empirical research? What about for the beliefs of practicing teachers? Teachers in specific disciplines? Teachers of a specific age or region or training background? Administrators? School-board members? Textbook publishers? Researchers themselves?

To start, read "_Self-Regulated Learning: Beliefs, Techniques, and Illusions_" (Bjork et al, 2013), then compare against the findings in "_Improving Students’ Learning With Effective Learning Techniques: Promising Directions From Cognitive and Educational Psychology_" (Dunlosky et al, 2013).

Then: see what _other_ influential papers reference each, and traverse the citation-tree from there.

And then... D3 visualizations? Nothing says "_hey! pay attention to this complex and ambiguous data_" like a nice, animated SVG...
