## What Are We Doing Here?

Each revisitation of a text on [the neuroscience of learning, or the evolution of language, or the cutting-edge of research into sequencing classroom activities] is haunted, quietly, by a shadow of superfluousness.

I wonder to what degree I was shaped by the experience of watching ingenuous, frustrated students expending heroic amounts of time and effort to learn, hamstrung all the while and betrayed by poor teaching. I’m thinking particularly of English-language learners in the post-Soviet educational system (from my time in Peace Corps Ukraine, where the teachers were inculcated in a opinionated, empirically-disproven methodology); however, they could equally apply to many ESL/ABE classrooms I’ve seen across the United States (where teachers were simply not trained in any pedagogical practice, correct or no.)

To obviate this further: in both cases, I proceed as granted that [available time and student energy] are not constraints; obviously, in reality either is rarely the case. But even if it were, even if 100% of the time the only barrier to [optimal uptake of a new skill or body of knowledge] were the teaching and learning practices implemented... that's not what I care for, apparently. It's certainly not what I read about.

I’ve turned this over, again and again, in my head: is it valuable, at all, to focus on `${the boundaries of our knowledge of how to make learning most effective}`? Or is it far, far more beneficial to humanity to more-widely deploy and encourage the known best practices we already have? And how would we even calculate the two? How would we compare their relative merit for `${humanity as it stands in 2019}`? 

I think, in the end, I'm resigned to fall back on selfishness: the newest topics in `${what we know about how humans learn, and about how to apply that knowledge to content and curriculum}` interests me. They have the strength to draw me away from board games, or movies, or programming. But spreading them to underserved communities; making access to that knowledge more equitable... those... don't. I disregard lived experience, that visceral anecdata from my own classrooms, and offices, and conferences, and cafes, in order that my impulsive brain may get a hit of that excitement from pure research. Because that's what it lights up on; that's what it finds engaging.

Anyway, here's Wonderwall. 

## Revisitations

_On reading the locations and generic responsibilities of [the lobes, cortex bands, and limbic system parts]:_  Given the (at least) [partially-proven value](https://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/body_scan_meditation#data-tab-evidence) of [body-scan meditation](https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/body-scan-for-pain) in affecting (at least) pain receptors in specific regions of the body, what might the outcomes be of adding specific regions of one’s skull to one's body-scan inventory?

That is, after beginning (as so many of these scripts do) with the general weight of the body, then moving from the feet upwards, finally through the throat and neck... what if the participant were then directed to e.g “_...bring your awareness to rest on a band running from your left ear to your right ear, across the top of your head..._” (i.e., to scan the somatosensory cortex)?

Helpfully, I'd made reference to “_massed practice_” (in contrast to “_distributed practice_”) without having defined either; while charmed by my past-self's faith in my ability to recognize terminology, I had to fall back on my DDG `${term} !g site:.edu` search to get these defined succinctly enough to contextualize past-self's notes. (_TL;DR: former is cramming; latter is SRS._)

Along the way, I encountered the following, from "_Distributed Practice in Verbal Recall Tasks: A Review and Quantitative Synthesis_" (Cepeda et al, 2006): 

> ...spaced (vs. massed) learning of items consistently shows benefits regardless of retention interval, and learning benefits increase with increased time lags between learning presentations... [but] once the interval between learning sessions reaches some relatively long amount of time, further increases either have no effect upon or decrease memory as measured in a later test. The magnitude of the observed distributed practice benefit depends on the joint effects of [interstudy interval] and retention interval; retention interval influences the peak of this function. 

> Distributing learning across different days (instead of grouping learning episodes within a single day) greatly improves the amount of material retained for sizable periods of time; the literature clearly suggests that distributing practice in this way is likely to markedly improve students’ retention of course material. 

So spaced-repetition is important: and within that, it's not merely the repetition-quality that matters, but the quality too of that spacing. Build them Leitner boxes, vary their intervals, and test the results.

But this article is over a decade old and, for all I know, largely unread. Checking its citation count on Google Scholar led me to [_Visible Learning_](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781134024124), a synthesis of "_over 800 meta-analyses on the influences on achievement in school-aged students._" 

A thirty (_...ninety_) minute meander down reviews of the book ([_The Economist_ cites its conclusions](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2016/06/11/teaching-the-teachers) as implicitly valid! Researchers from both [the institutional](https://robertslavinsblog.wordpress.com/2018/06/21/john-hattie-is-wrong/) and [the computational](https://academiccomputing.wordpress.com/2013/08/05/book-review-visible-learning/) spheres of education have similar considerable  issues with his methodology!), however, ended with an abrupt interjection of those pangs from my above "_What Are We Doing Here?_" 

When, as that _Economist_ piece lays out, the problems lie more less in best-practice implementation/dissemination than in its identification... well, wouldn't those two be the places to engage? What could be my next steps t-

At that moment, I was reminded of what prompted this exploration in the first place. Here's the note I'd written so many months prior, the one that set this digression off:

> Effective practice starts with massed practice (_for fast learning_) and proceeds to distributed practice later for retention: thus each test should not only query new material, but also allow students to practice important older content.

That offhand mention of the _value_ of massed practice: and immediately, I became curious about research into that. Have there been studies comparing `${the effects of a spaced-repetition system where the first encounter with the new content is "massed"}` with `${a spaced-repetition system where the first encounter is not significantly longer/more repetitive than future encounters}`? What other variables might weaken or strengthen, lengthen or contract the encounter-interval? Back to gScholar, and then t-

Dogs, and spots; leopards, and tricks. 

Sigh.

## Next Steps

One next step in marrying these two untouching, parallel paths (_best-practice identification, and best-practice implementation_) might be to compare where they most visibly diverge: where do people’s beliefs about `${how teaching and learning best take place}` most wildly diverge from `${what the research actually shows}`? What about that divergence against the beliefs of teachers? Teachers in specific geographic areas? Teachers from a specific age/training demographics? Administrators? School-board members? Academics? 

To start, it's probably worth pushing "_Self-Regulated Learning: Beliefs, Techniques, and Illusions_" (Bjork et al, 2013) to the front of the reading queue, then (possibly) comparing against (especially given one shared author and similar date of publishing) the findings in "_Improving Students’ Learning With Effective Learning Techniques: Promising Directions From Cognitive and Educational Psychology_" (Dunlosky et al, 2013). Then: see who's cited it, and move from there.

If that process doesn't reveal some nifty conclusions, then perhaps move to the two "_Learning for Life: The Opportunity for Technology to Transform Adult Education_" papers by Tyton Partners. 

If it does, then... D3 visualizations?
