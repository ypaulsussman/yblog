## What Are We Doing Here?

Me and screens need to sort out our relationship. I originally read this book because it was one of the few relatively-current books in the linguistics section at Hennepin County Library, and I was looking for ways to feed my brain in the evenings.<sup>1</sup> Ways, specifically, that didn’t involve bombarding my face with blue light.

My revisitation of these notes takes place on a Kindle, whose services I’ve appropriated by converting the initial `.md` file to a `.epub`, then from there to the requisite `.mobi`.<sup>2</sup>  I initially downloaded [KindleGen](https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211), but it turns out you can get to the same `.epub => .mobi` behavior from [Kindle Previewer's]() UI. Which, perhaps, was a false step on my part: [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/getting-started.html) has been nothing but a CLI delight, a five-minute breeze to learn and use.

In any case, this was a fortuitously-timed revisit, the lightweight material providing a pleasant contrast to what's otherwise been a stressful, ActiveRecord syntax-plagued week. Let's see what we uncovered.

## Revisitation

I find it interesting that (_modulo a five-century sidetrip as a semi-pictorial script_) the first writing coevolved with the first lists and categorization systems (_for use in agrarian-economic administration - thanks, Sumeria!_)

Given how visually-oriented we are as a species, I wonder if other examples could be teased out of history, other cases where `${new models of thinking, of ordering ideas}` coevolved with `${new models of graphical representation}`? The relationship between, well, `${charts, plots, and other data-visualization}` and `${inductive logic, mass usage of statistics, “thinking probabilistically”}` first comes to mind: time to explore `lovely_spouse`'s Tufte books, then?

The really interesting question, I suppose, would be what paradigms or frameworks for thinking are _contemporarily_ emergent: and what visual tools might they coevolve with.

Even at first read, one highlight was [The Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition's experiment](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/CABN.2.2.89) with using (_progressively less-_) exaggerated minimal pairs to train the `/r/` and `/l/` phonemes among L1-Japanese speakers. Or, rather, the promising results reported in this book: even after departing the field, I still get giddy at the scent of a silver bullet for even a subset (_phonemic inventory_) of a structure (_pronunciation_) underpinning adult language learning.

Alas, that’s not really (_as I read it_) what the actual paper was even about: it seems far more focused on disentangling empirical evidence for a connectionist neural model of acoustic-processing acquisition. Even the passage within the "Discussion" section allocated to learner outcomes is somewhat tepid in the results it reports:

> _Without feedback, 3 days of adaptive training produced substantial improvements, but 3 days of fixed training produced no benefit relative to control, consistent with the Hebbian account. With feedback, both fixed and adaptive training led to robust improvements, and the benefit of training transferred to a second continuum (e.g.,_ road–load _)._

> _In contrast to the fixed training condition without feedback, fixed training with feedback produced very robust learning. Indeed, the subjects in this condition showed learning as good as and, by some measures, slightly better than the subjects who received adaptive training with feedback._

> _In any case, our finding that feedback does make a very large difference, at least in the fixed training conditions of our experiment, makes it clear that Hebb’s idea about the basis of changes in the strengths of connections between neurons does not provide a full account of the factors that influence perceptual learning._

At first glance, this sounds like (_from a purely applied, pedagogical standpoint_) a validation of using corrective feedback in pronunciation practice: the TESOL equivalent of a null hypothesis.

\*\*\* **Update 1:** Ha! Serves me right for not going to the primary source... the Times article I'm referencing from this book, "[_Old Brains Can Learn New Language Tricks_](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/20/science/old-brains-can-learn-new-language-tricks.html)," was published in 1999... while the paper I'm referencing above was released in 2002. 

I’m going to spin this as a demonstration of the academic process at its best: the professor referenced in the Times article above is a co-author on the 2002 paper; I find it moderately encouraging that, three years after a glowing write-up in the popular press, they were willing/able to publish follow-up research that qualified the initial findings as less robust and impactful than initially reported. (_The follow-up findings naturally not getting the same level of generalist coverage? That, alas, I'd been resigned to._) \*\*\* 

Intriguingly, the 2002 article was referenced in a [2017 meta-analysis of perception training research](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0142716417000418), but not used for the actual analysis (_by contrast, several other papers' exclusions are explained._) 

For what it's worth, that meta-analysis concludes that: 

> _(a) perception-only training leads to small-sized production gains;_

> _(b) there is a small to medium, not statistically significant relationship between perception gains and production gains;_

> _(c) production gains are larger for obstruents than for vowels or sonorants; and_

> _(d) there are five features of perception-only training that likely encourage larger production gains: second language contexts, beginner-level of L2 experience, training at home, a short training, and the existence of phonetic instruction._

Given the absence of significant discussion within this article of different _types_ of perception-only training, I feel comfortable inferring that the general academic focus has moved on from what the 2002 paper referred to as “_adaptive training._”

While it’s minorly disappointing that the trajectory of this personal exploration arced from “_1999 article in respected newspaper proclaiming language-teaching tactic with outsize benefits_“ to “_2017 meta-analysis dismissing that tactic out of hand,_“ at a meta level I can’t help but be grateful, even somewhat humbled, at the sheer abundance of freely-available, easily-accessible, high-quality data online.

Time to re-up that EFF donation.

## Next Steps

...nowhere? I don’t know, this was a fun read on the first pass, and -- even better -- equally enjoyable on review of the notes I had clipped: but I don’t see any toy apps or projects percolating forth from it. And that’s OK! Hell, in some ways it’s a relief: this "Revisitations" adventure has tilled up more weekend projects than I have weekends for. 

Though (_per "Update 1" above_) the idea of a site scraping and popularizing the results of research that appeared solely in the various "[_negative, null, and inconclusive results_](https://collections.plos.org/missing-pieces)"-journals -- Wikipedia lists several! -- is compelling.


\*\*\* **Update 2:** Well, looks like that _was_ [an idea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Hypothesis:_The_Journal_of_Unlikely_Science), and that idea was [kill.](https://farm7.staticflickr.com/6133/6015067182_c0a6fd0e8f_b.jpg) Sparse information on what exactly happened to the site, however. \*\*\*

<sup>1</sup> You know, I initially recoiled upon first using the cliché “_feed (one’s) brain._” In such situations I typically enumerate the subtext I want to convey, then rephrase according to that. 

Here, however, that exercise only reinforced the selection: “_to exercise one’s brain_” has an unwanted connotation of diligence and self-improvement — this is an 8 PM weekday relaxation, after all — while “_to entertain one’s brain_” conveys both a distractedness and a jubilation that I find inaccurate. I suppose this is why they become clichés, then: their actual palpable usefulness, albeit in targeted, limited situations.

<sup>2</sup> A process reminiscent of `.avi < > .mp4 < > .flac < > .ogg` munging and conversions from... 2001? 1999? What’s old is new again! Though, if you had told my high-school self that someday I would find it necessary to repeat the same shenanigans for _books_...? 

And also: damn. That’s  two footnotes in four sentences. The slide into manqué Foster-Wallace (_Foster-Wallachian?_) prose continues.
