## Where We've Come From

I first began with assignments to read articles in Ukrainian. This was an excellent source of new vocabulary, but the quantity of new lexis was overwhelming, so retention was poor. Moreover, my interest in the content, combined with the size of the articles, caused me to spend more time with a focus on meaning (_in the Michael Long sense_) than I would have preferred.

I then moved to translating sentences that my instructor (_far better in English than I in Ukrainian_) would construct and email to me. This enabled me to pay more attention to form:meaning interactions, but had three downsides. 

First, the language I engaged with often constituted levels of complexity well outside the (_admittedly idealized_) “i + 1”  buffer zone for maximal optimal uptake and learning. This would most frequently manifest on the far side of that theoretical region: I would often translate low-frequency, accuracy-demanding collocations or idioms.

The precision of these linguistic bundles exacerbated the limitations of written corrective feedback. I couldn’t, for instance, synchronously request whether a correction was due to an extrapolatable rule, or a fossilized, unique quirk of the language's history; nor could I provide several analogous cases to confirm my intuitions of proper use based on that feedback.

To be clear, these set expressions would, in themselves, still be enjoyable and valuable to learn, even despite the scarcity of reactive feedback and available time to study (_and corollary importance of aligning target language to specific communicative needs._) What compounded the issue was the difficulty in returning to meaningfully engage with any previous week’s homework: and, thus, to successfully include any of its contents in long-term memory.

## Where We're At

From those demands has evolved the current system, and I’m largely happy with how it’s performed for the last several months. Currently, each week I:

1. Spend half an hour (_on laptop_) writing approximately 5-10 sentences in Ukrainian, along with (_what I hope to somewhat-accurately be_) their English translations;
1. Email those sentences to my tutor;
1. Engage in a two-hour video lesson (_on laptop_) with said tutor on a weekend morning, during which...
  * We begin with free conversation; any errors are highlighted for learner self-correction, and new/grasped-for language is provided.
  * At the tutor's discretion/learner's request, any lexical/morphosyntactic items from either stream can be typed into the text-chat for storage.
  * We move to reviewing the Ukrainian sentences, with the learner reading off each sentence and the tutor prompting self-correction of errors (_and, sometimes, providing targeted pronunciation drilling._)
  * We return to free conversation, now consciously attempting to weave the incidentally-occurring lexis and prior errors into both our speech.
1. After the lesson, I'll add the (_now-corrected_) Ukrainian sentences from the week's homework to Anki, with their English equivalent as the prompt. (_Also... on laptop._)
1. I'll pay for the video lessons, and schedule new ones (_wait for it: on mobile, through italki's hilariously counterintuitive native app._)
1. Throughout the coming week, I'll spend ~5min each morning practicing the cards presented by Anki's system (_on mobile._)
1. Finally, returning to the top of this list, I'll try to weave 10-20 of the items encountered during the lesson into the coming week's sentences.

That ends up being around three hours a week, two of which are (_at least partially_) conversing with a human I like and would probably chat away with anyway. I think that's a reasonable expenditure to stave off language attrition... if, in fact, that's what it's having any success doing. (_I can hope, but it's not like I'd be willing to shell out to annually take the Ukrainian equivalent of the IELTS, even were such an exam to meaningfully exist._)

## Where We Might Go

I had planned for this section to outline a unified app, one that combined my current workflow into a single mobile interface.

Usefully, though, I began with a reflection on what I’m currently doing, and how that set of practices has evolved: a reflection that has prompted me to realize, now, just how little would be gained by integrating all functionality into a single app.

When I think through the greatest pain points in my ongoing system, what comes to mind is the seemingly-superfluous second password request on attempting to schedule a lesson within the italki app (_followed only by the difficulty in actually reaching the “schedule lesson” interface from that app's dashboard._)

On contemplation, there’s never been a case where I had wished for a more seamless transition of data from one device or program to another. So much for that angle!

There is a possible future weakness of my current system, and it hinges on a parallel realization I'd had while writing.

Anecxperidotally, adult learners of `${L2} as a Foreign Language` are either doing it...
1. for business/academic interests, in which case they usually have both
    * a specific and falsifiable performance goal, and 
    * a specific and falsifiable time constraint: and, thus, 
    * a fairly rigorous learning schedule (_i.e. they're taking structured courses, attending an immersion program, etc._), or
2. for personal/cultural/intrinsic interest, in which case they
    * are operating without a time constraint,
    * don't have (_summative or formative_) performance benchmarks they're checking against, and
    * perhaps paradoxically<sup>1</sup> are at greater risk of lapse due to quotidian interference.

I'm firmly in the latter camp, currently: however, if I shifted into the former (_let's say that long-awaited faculty appointment to_ [_Ivan Franko_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Lviv) _finally came through, or_ `${lovely_spouse}` _took an unexpected interest in the ecological preservation of the Eastern Carpathians..._) I'm not sure how I'd shift into high-gear, as it were. 

I'd prefer not to redesign (_who are we kidding, re-evolve_) a second, separate version of the language-learning system that worked for me, especially given the additional constraints/features that the greater intensity/pace would demand.

It'd be nice, instead, if there were a "_ramp up/ramp down_" mechanic, akin to those selectable by e.g. treadmills. I'm not thinking of increasing the pace of memorization -- that ignores the logic/evidence of SRS algorithms to date -- but rather supplementing it with several parallel, cross-referential exercises.

## Next Steps

My feeling is that the current system buys its convenience partially at the expense of extended discourse. I think, currently, that’s a reasonable exchange: I recall an early experiment with video-tutoring homework which resulted in me taking ~90 minutes to decode, transcribe, and translate a three-minute documentary short. I just checked the transcription, and I’ve retained no new lexis from that exercise. 

Obviously, though, "_new lexis_" is not the only metric by which to evaluate a language-learning exercise. Development of the four macroskills (_reading, writing, listening, speaking_) is harder to quantify progress in: however, I would argue (_at least partially because of that difficulty_) those skills are equally or more important to ensure exercises for. Two such exercises initially come to mind.

In both cases, I've expanded and refined early video-tutoring homework tasks that I later discarded as too intensive for my current availablity and goals. As such, they meet my personal requirement that each exercise rely on free materials, and require no more than a few minutes of video-tutor work to prepare input/correct output. And, to integrate macroskill usage, the two supplemental exercises that I envision would change message channels across performative modes: the former exercise provides written input and elicits verbal output; the latter inverts this.

**Exercise 01: Interview Transcripts**
* Background: 
  * Earlier, I often read interview excerpts from [The Ukrainians](https://theukrainians.org/ihor-lylo/)
  * I shifted to these from [news articles.](https://www.bbc.com/ukrainian)
  * While both provide opportunitites to learn multi-sentence organization techniques, I preferred the former for several reasons.
    * Interviews provide a wider range of field-specific content and tone, unique to a given topic and speaker.
    * Transcribed interviews provide a combination of written and spoken discourse: natural speech, but polished by an editor. 
    * Interviews provide different types of rhetoric: often not merely descriptive or narrative, but also argumentative or instructional.
    * Interviews' Q&A format conveniently delimits smaller blocks of a`ccessible text that both connect to form a logical whole and (_unlike a news report's paragraphs_) can easily be engaged with in isolation; 
* Envisioned Sequence: 
  1. Video tutor (_"VT"_) selects and sends a link to an interview;
  1. Student (_"ST"_) reads interview in L2,
    * translating from e.g. Google when absolutely necessary but 
    * limiting collection of new lexis to <5 samples;
  1. [Optional] ST adapts several questions from the interview (_or creates new questions in response to statements from the interview_);
  1. [Optional] ST records their reading of those questions;
  1. ST either receives or [Optional] exchanges questions with VT, 
  1. ST records (_real-time, no written preparation_) answers to the VT's questions;
  1. ST sends or [Optional] exchanges video of answers with VT, 
  1. In weekly session, VT and ST review mistakes;
  1. Following the session, ST re-records answers (_and adds selected erroneous sentences to SRS_).

**Exercise 02: Long-Form Listen**
* Background: 
  * Earlier, I transcribed short clips, often news reports or [infotainment for brand positioning.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CU5uBza7mv0)
  * The issue encountered at that time was the tasks' prioritization of explicit transcription and translation, rather than practice of the listening skill for extraction/creation of meaning.
    * For reasons now unfathomable to me, I'd not seen fit to apply, apparently, any of learnings from my literal decade-plus of teaching languages to that personal exercise.
    * I've tried to remedy that in the sequence below by focusing foremostly on meaning-focused listening.
  * I know most introductory texts on language pedagogy discuss the historical underestimation of listening questions that elicit bottom-up processing, and I’m sensitive to the fact that the following sequence does little to prompt such processing.
    * It’s not (_...deliberately_) an overcorrection from those earlier interactions with audio media.
    * Rather, it's an acknowledgment of the reality that, to create questions that engage learner to parse the text starting from the smallest levels of form (_i.e. phonetic > phonemic > syllabic > lexical > syntactic features, etc_), one needs a background in the linguistic structures of the L2, and time to analyze the text.
    * That's a pretty serious ask from your VT.
  * Even asking for 3-5 contextual, inference-based, semantics-focused quetions from a native speaker with some-to-no-training in language teaching is a lot. For this, I aim to provide a framework for creation of top-down listening exercises (_...a framework which I'm not providing here, on account of it being essentially copied, unmodified, from a [certain prized textbook.](https://www.worldcat.org/title/teaching-by-principles-an-interactive-approach-to-language-pedagogy/)_)
* Envisioned Sequence: 
  1. VT selects a short (~3-7min?) clip, and (_using above-mentioned framework_) drafts (~3-7?) questions (_in L2_);
  1. VT sends ST the link to clip, and questions;
  1. ST listens to clip, and writes answers (_in L2_);
  1. ST writes short (~3-7 sentence?) review of clip, answering any of the following questions:

  ```
  * What did you like most?
  * What did you like least?
  * What did this remind you of?
  * What did you already know about the topic before you read this?
  * What new things did you learn?
  * What questions do you still have?
  ```

  5. ST sends answers and review to VT; 
  5. VT provides written corrective feedback;
  5. ST corrects their answers/review and resubmits to VT;
  5. In weekly session, discuss (_any extant, and only then first-pass_) mistakes.
  5. Following the session, ST extracts selected erroneous sentences to SRS.

So, then, for the future: step one would be to experiment with each of these exercises over a sustained period of time, before a (_potentially unnecessary_) step two of integrating all the above workflows into a unified application that would direct (_via separate VT- and ST-facing dashboards_) required behavior. 

Making step zero, I suppose, to get both [1] the free time to engage into that sort of involved, protracted foreign-language learning, and [2] an extrinsic motivation to do such.
