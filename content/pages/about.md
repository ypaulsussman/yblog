## Who are you, and why should I care?
I’m Y Sussman! I live in MPLS, MN, where I write code for work and teach for fun. (_I used to teach for work and write code for fun._)

I moved here a couple years back from New York, where I went to grad school (_linguistics_), had fun (_teaching at libraries and universities; building language-learning apps_), and got married (_the best!_) 

Prior to that I lived in Warsaw (_teaching at university_), rural Ukraine (_Peace Corps_), and Wisconsin (_no one asked me; it was the 80's_.)

And you probably shouldn’t.

## Sick blog - how’d you make it?

I didn’t! This is almost byte-for-byte the [Lumen](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen) starter for [Gatsby.](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/features/) No, [seriously.](https://lumen.netlify.com/) 

The code is pretty much entirely the work of others: my adaptation has largely been to rip out the pieces that made it difficult for me to rapidly reason about. You know, little things like “the entire CMS admin view” and “static typechecking.” 

(_That’s right, to be clear: my personal addition to this codebase has been purely to make it **worse**. But... faster to work with!_)

## So why a blog, though?

Eh, I should do more brain calisthenics. A good way to do that, in my experience, is to push thoughts into writing, and then reexamine them. 

And a good way to _that,_ or so I hear, is to maintain a public-facing collection of those writings: one that shames you into perpetually refining and expanding it.

Ta da!
