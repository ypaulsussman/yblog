"Truly fine poetry must be read aloud. A good poem does not allow itself to be read in a low voice or silently. If we can read it silently, it is not a valid poem: a poem demands pronunciation. Poetry always remembers that it was an oral art before it was a written art. It remembers that it was first song.","Jorge Luis Borges"
"The aesthetic event is something as evident, as immediate, as indefinable as love, the taste of fruit, of water. We feel poetry as we feel the closeness of a woman, or as we feel a mountain or a bay. If we feel it immediately, why dilute it with other words, which no doubt will be weaker than our feelings?","Jorge Luis Borges"
"As I think of the many myths, there is one that is very harmful, and that is the myth of countries... I suppose in the long run, governments and countries will die out and we'll be just, well, cosmopolitans.","Jorge Luis Borges"
"A writer - and, I believe, generally all persons - must think that whatever happens to him or her is a resource. All things have been given to us for a purpose, and an artist must feel this more intensely. All that happens to us, including our humiliations, our misfortunes, our embarrassments, all is given to us as raw material, as clay, so that we may shape our art.","Jorge Luis Borges"
"I cannot walk through the suburbs in the solitude of the night without thinking that the night pleases us because it suppresses idle details, just as our memory does.","Jorge Luis Borges"

"The arts put man at the center of the universe, whether he belongs there or not. Military science, on the other hand, treats man as garbageâ€• and his children, and his cities, too.

Stillâ€• I deny that contemptibility, and I beg you to deny it, through the creation of and appreciation of art.","Kurt Vonnegut"

"In the course of many centuries a few laborsaving devices have been introduced into the mental kitchen â€“ alcohol, coffee, tobacco, Benzedrine, etc â€“ but these are very crude, constantly breaking down, and liable to injure the cook. Literary composition in the twentieth century A.D. is pretty much what it was in the twentieth century B.C.: nearly everything has still to be done by hand.","W.H. Auden"
"The poet who writes 'free' verse is like Robinson Crusoe on his desert island: he must do all his cooking, laundry and darning for himself.

"It doesn't seem to me that this fantastically marvelous universe, this tremendous range of time and space and different kinds of animals, and all the different planets, and all these atoms with all their motions, and so on, all this complicated thing can merely be a stage so that God can watch human beings struggle for good and evil - which is the view that religion has. The stage is too big for the drama.","Richard Feynman"
"Poets say science takes away from the beauty of the stars â€• mere globs of gas atoms. Nothing is 'mere'. I too can see the stars on a desert night, and feel them. But do I see less or more? The vastness of the heavens stretches my imagination â€• stuck on this carousel my little eye can catch one-million-year-old light. A vast pattern â€• of which I am a part... What is the pattern or the meaning or the why? It does not do harm to the mystery to know a little more about it. For far more marvelous is the truth than any artists of the past imagined it. Why do the poets of the present not speak of it? What men are poets who can speak of Jupiter if he were a man, but if he is an immense spinning sphere of methane and ammonia must be silent?","Richard Feynman"
"I have a friend who's an artist, and he sometimes takes a view which I don't agree with. He'll hold up a flower and say, 'Look how beautiful it is,' and I'll agree. But then he'll say, 'I, as an artist, can see how beautiful a flower is. But you, as a scientist, take it all apart and it becomes dull.' I think he's kind of nutty. [...] There are all kinds of interesting questions that come from a knowledge of science, which only adds to the excitement and mystery and awe of a flower. It only adds. I don't understand how it subtracts.","Richard Feynman"
"Is no one inspired by our present picture of the universe? This value of science remains unsung by singers, you are reduced to hearing not a song or poem, but an evening lecture about it. This is not yet a scientific age.","Richard Feynman"
"The scientist has a lot of experience with ignorance and doubt and uncertainty, and this experience is of very great importance, I think. When a scientist doesnâ€™t know the answer to a problem, he is ignorant. When he has a hunch as to what the result is, he is uncertain. And when he is pretty damn sure of what the result is going to be, he is still in some doubt. We have found it of paramount importance that in order to progress, we must recognize our ignorance and leave room for doubt. Scientific knowledge is a body of statements of varying degrees of certaintyâ€•some most unsure, some nearly sure, but none absolutely certain. Now, we scientists are used to this, and we take it for granted that it is perfectly consistent to be unsure, that it is possible to live and not know. But I donâ€™t know whether everyone realizes this is true. Our freedom to doubt was born out of a struggle against authority in the early days of science. It was a very deep and strong struggle: permit us to questionâ€•to doubtâ€•to not be sure. I think that it is important that we do not forget this struggle and thus perhaps lose what we have gained.","Richard Feynman"
"Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal.","T.S. Eliot"
"The bad poet is usually unconscious where he ought to be conscious, and conscious where he ought to be unconscious. Both errors tend to make him 'personal.' Poetry is not a turning loose of emotion, but an escape from emotion; it is not the expression of personality, but an escape from personality. But, of course, only those who have personality and emotions know what it means to want to escape from these things.","T.S. Eliot"
"I sometimes wondered what the use of any of the arts was. The best thing I could come up with was what I call the canary in the coal mine theory of the arts. This theory says that artists are useful to society because they are so sensitive. They are super-sensitive. They keel over like canaries in poison coal mines long before more robust types realize that there is any danger whatsoever.","Kurt Vonnegut"
"I do feel that evolution is being controlled by some sort of divine engineer. I can't help thinking that. And this engineer knows exactly what he or she is doing and why, and where evolution is headed. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve got giraffes and hippopotami and the clap.","Kurt Vonnegut"
"Where is home? I've wondered where home is, and I realized, it's not Mars or someplace like that, it's Indianapolis when I was nine years old. I had a brother and a sister, a cat and a dog, and a mother and a father and uncles and aunts. And there's no way I can get there again.","Kurt Vonnegut"

"Which brings us to the arts, whose purpose, in common with astrology, is to use frauds in order to make human beings seem more wonderful than they really are. Dancers show us human beings who move much more gracefully than human beings really move. Films and books and plays show us people talking much more entertainingly than people really talk, make paltry human enterprises seem important. Singers and musicians show us human beings making sounds far more lovely than human beings really make. Architects give us temples in which something marvelous is obviously going on. Actually, practically nothing is going on inside. And on and on.","Kurt Vonnegut"

"The main thing that I learned about conspiracy theory is that conspiracy theorists actually believe in a conspiracy because that is more comforting. The truth of the world is that it is chaotic. The truth is, that it is not the Jewish banking conspiracy or the gray aliens or the 12-foot reptiloids from another dimension that are in control.

"Perhaps the most overrated virtue in our list of shoddy virtues is that of giving. Giving builds up the ego of the giver, makes him superior and higher and larger than the receiver... Receiving, on the other hand, if it is well-done, requires a fine balance of self-knowledge and kindness. It requires humility and tact and great understanding of relationships. In receiving, you cannot appear, even to yourself, better or stronger or wiser than the giver, although you must be wiser to do it well... It requires self-esteem to receive - not self-love but just a pleasant acquaintance and liking for oneself.","John Steinbeck"

"I (mention) Arthur Schopenhauer's well known fable, a story Freud liked enough to cite in his book on group psychology (and) I paraphrase the fable as follows: 'A troop of porcupines is milling about on a cold winter's day. In order to keep from freezing, the animals move closer together. Just as they are close enough to huddle, however, they start to poke each other with their quills. In order to stop the pain, they spread out, lose the advantage of commingling, and begin to shiver. This sends them back in search of each other, and the cycle repeats as they struggle to find a comfortable distance between entanglement and freezing.' The story spoke to Freud as a lesson about boundaries. ('No one can tolerate a too intimate approach to his neighbor.') It also spoke to his belief that love is everywhere a thorny affair. Freud wrote: 'The evidence ... shows that almost every intimate emotional relation between two people which lasts for some time - marriage, friendship, the relations between parents and children -contains a sediment of feelings of aversion and hostility, which only escapes perception as a result of repression'... All relationships ... require us to contain contradictory feelings for the same person. As the poet Molly Peacock observed: 'There must be room in love for hate.' -Deborah Anna Luepnitz",""

"Patriotism is proud of a country's virtues and eager to correct its deficiencies; it also acknowledges the legitimate patriotism of other countries, with their own specific virtues. The pride of nationalism, however, trumpets its country's virtues and denies its deficiencies, while it is contemptuous toward the virtues of other countries. It wants to be, and proclaims itself to be, 'the greatest', but greatness is not required of a country; only goodness is.","Sydney J. Harris"

"Eight rules for writing fiction: 1. Use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted.  2. Give the reader at least one character he or she can root for.  3. Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water.  4. Every sentence must do one of two things - reveal character or advance the action.  5. Start as close to the end as possible.  6. Be a sadist. Now matter how sweet and innocent your leading characters, make awful things happen to them - in order that the reader may see what they are made of.  7. Write to please just one person. If you open a window and make love to the world, so to speak, your story will get pneumonia.  8. Give your readers as much information as possible as soon as possible. To heck with suspense. Readers should have such complete understanding of what is going on, where and why, that they could finish the story themselves, should cockroaches eat the last few pages.","Kurt Vonnegut"

"You can approach the act of writing with nervousness, excitement, hopefulness, or even despair - the sense that you can never completely put on the page what's in your mind and heart. You can come to the act with your fists clenched and your eyes narrowed, ready to kick ass and take down names. You can come to it because you want a girl to marry you or because you want to change the world. Come to it any way but lightly. Let me say it again: you must not come lightly to the blank page.","Stephen King"
"Any writer, I suppose, feels that the world into which he was born is nothing less than a conspiracy against the cultivation of his talent.","James Baldwin"
"Inspiration is wonderful when it happens, but the writer must develop an approach for the rest of the time... The wait is simply too long.","Leonard Bernstein"
"The important thing is that there should be a space of time, say four hours a day at least, when a professional writer doesn't do anything else but write. He doesn't have to write, and if he doesn't feel like it he shouldn't try. He can look out of the window or stand on his head or writhe on the floor, but he is not to do any other positive thing, not read, not write letters, glance at magazines, or write checks. Either write or nothing.","Raymond Chandler"
"Poetry, indeed, cannot be translated; and, therefore, it is the poets that preserve the languages; for we would not be at the trouble to learn a language if we could have all that is written in it just as well in a translation. But as the beauties of poetry cannot be preserved in any language except that in which it was originally written, we learn the language.","Samuel Johnson"

"Language is the apparel in which your thoughts parade in public. Never clothe them in vulgar and shoddy attire.","George W. Crane"
"A man's name is not like a mantle which merely hangs about him, and which one perchance may safely twitch and pull, but a perfectly fitting garment, which, like the skin, has grown over and over him, at which one cannot rake and scrape without injuring the man himself.","Johann Wolfgang von Goethe"
"The difference between fiction and reality is that fiction has to make sense.","Tom Clancy"

"Man's capacity for justice makes democracy possible, but man's inclination to injustice makes democracy necessary.","Reinhold Niebuhr"
"The novel is... the greatest enemy of truth and honesty that was ever invented. Itâ€™s a vast, sentimentalizing structure that reassures the reader and at every point offers the comfort of secure moral frameworks and recognizable characters. ...the main function of the novel was to carry out a kind of moral criticism of life. But the writer has no business making moral judgments or trying to set himself up as a one-man or one-woman magistrateâ€™s court. I think itâ€™s far better, as Burroughs did and Iâ€™ve tried to do in my small way, to tell the truth.","JG Ballard"
"Our lives today are not conducted in linear terms. They are much more quantified; a stream of random events is taking place.","JG Ballard"
"All over the world major museums have bowed to the influence of Disney and become theme parks in their own right. The past, whether Renaissance Italy or ancient Egypt, is reassimilated and homogenized into its most digestible form. Desperate for the new, but disappointed with anything but the familiar, we recolonise past and future. The same trend can be seen in personal relationships, in the way people are expected to package themselves, their emotions and sexuality in attractive and instantly appealing forms.","JG Ballard"
"Everything is becoming science fiction. From the margins of an almost invisible literature has sprung the intact reality of the 20th century.","JG Ballard"
"The cine-camera and television set allow us to perceive slow motion. The concept of anything other than real time had never occurred to anybody until the first slow-motion movies were shown, and this radically altered people's perceptions of nature.","JG Ballard"
"In wartime Shanghai I saw so many horrors... Civilised life is based on a huge number of illusions in which we all collaborate willingly. The trouble is, we forget after a while that they are illusions and we are deeply shocked when reality is torn down around us.","JG Ballard"
"We live in a world ruled by fictions of every kind â€• mass merchandising, advertising, politics conducted as a branch of advertising, the instant translation of science and technology into popular imagery, the increasing blurring and intermingling of identities within the realm of consumer goods, the preempting of any free or original imaginative response to experience by the television screen. We live inside an enormous novel. For the writer in particular it is less and less necessary for him to invent the fictional content of his novel. The fiction is already there. The writer's task is to invent the reality.","JG Ballard"
"Human beings today ... are surrounded by huge institutions we can never penetrate: the City [London's Wall Street], the banking system, political and advertising conglomerates, vast entertainment enterprises. They've made themselves user friendly, but they define the tastes to which we conform. They're rather subtle, subservient tyrants, but no less sinister for that.","JG Ballard"

"In my youth I thought of writing a satire on mankind; but now in my age I think I should write an apology for them.","Horace Walpole"
"Keeping a journal is a lonely man's habit, it betrays the vices of introspection and social withdrawal, even a kind of Narcissism... It has certain things to recommend it, it keeps a recorded continuity between his past and present selves, it gives him the comforting reassurance that shocks, defeats, disappointments are all snowed under by the pages and pages of new experience that still keep flaking down over him as be continues through time, and promises that this comforting snowfall of obliteration will go right on as long as be himself keeps going.","Tennessee Williams"
"Perhaps I was never meant to exist at all, but if I hadn't, a number of my created beings would have been denied their passionate existence. ...I am observing my life and the approaching conclusion of my life and I see a long, long stretch of desolation about me, now at the end. Or will I yet survive? In what condition, under what circumstance? ... The best I can say for myself is that I worked like hell.","Tennessee Williams"

"People who see life as anything more than pure entertainment are missing the point.","George Carlin"
"For a while, I thought of myself as an atheist until I realized it was a belief, too. It's a shame everything has to have a label.","George Carlin"
"You know, if you're an American and you're born at this time in history especially, you're lucky. We all are. We won the world history Powerball lottery, but a little modesty about it might keep the heat off of us. I can't stand the people who say things like, 'We built this country!' You built nothing. I think the railroads were pretty much up by 1980.","Bill Maher"

"If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot.","Stephen King"
"Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.","George Bernard Shaw"
"Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth, with the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have no yesterday, and no tomorrow. To forget time, to forgive life, to be at peace.","Oscar Wilde"
"The truth comes as conqueror only because we have lost the art of receiving it as guest.","Rabindranath Tagore"
"All poetry is supposed to be instructive but in an unnoticeable manner; it is supposed to make us aware of what it would be valuable to instruct ourselves in; we must deduce the lesson on our own, just as with life.","Johann Wolfgang von Goethe"
"Who is the happiest of men? He who values the merits of others, // And in their pleasure takes joy, even as though 'twere his own.","Johann Wolfgang von Goethe"

"Most human beings have an almost infinite capacity for taking things for granted.","Aldous Huxley"
"It is a bit embarrassing to have been concerned with the human problem all one's life and find at the end that one has no more to offer by way of advice than 'Try to be a little kinder.'","Aldous Huxley"
"To see ourselves as others see us is a most salutary gift. Hardly less important is the capacity to see others as they see themselves.","Aldous Huxley"
"Human judges can show mercy. But against the laws of nature, there is no appeal.","Arthur C Clarke"
"One of the biggest roles of science fiction is to prepare people to accept the future without pain and to encourage a flexibility of mind. Politicians should read science fiction, not westerns and detective stories.","Arthur C Clarke"
"The greatest tragedy in mankind's entire history may be the hijacking of morality by religion.","Arthur C Clarke"
"We are all atheists about most of the gods that societies have ever believed in. Some of us just go one god further.","Richard Dawkins"

"If I could be sure of doing with my books as much as my [doctor] father did for the sick!","Marcel Proust"
"The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.","Isaac Asimov"
"The long run is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the long run we are all dead.","John Maynard Keynes"
"When the accumulation of wealth is no longer of high social importance, there will be great changes in the code of morals. ...The love of money as a possession - as distinguished from the love of money as a means to the enjoyments and realities of life - will be recognised for what it is, a somewhat disgusting morbidity, one of those semi-criminal, semi-pathological propensities which one hands over with a shudder to the specialists in mental disease... But beware! The time for all this is not yet. For at least another hundred years we must pretend to ourselves and to everyone that fair is foul and foul is fair; for foul is useful and fair is not. Avarice and usury and precaution must be our gods for a little longer still.","John Maynard Keynes"
"The difficulty lies, not in [developing] new ideas, but in escaping from the old ones.","John Maynard Keynes"
"A decent provision for the poor is the true test of civilisation.","Samuel Johnson"
"In the struggle between yourself and the world second the world.","Franz Kafka"
"Literature becomes the living memory of a nation.","Alexander Solzhenitsyn"
"One can promise actions, but not feelings, for the latter are involuntary. He who promises to love forever or hate forever or be forever faithful to someone is promising something that is not in his power.","Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche"
"A great book should leave you with many experiences, and slightly exhausted at the end. You live several lives while reading it.","William Styron"
"Nations have recently been led to borrow billions for war; no nation has ever borrowed largely for education. Probably, no nation is rich enough to pay for both war and civilization. We must make our choice; we cannot have both.","Abraham Flexner"

"Every nation mocks at other nations, and all are right.","Arthur Schopenhauer"
"Mostly it is loss which teaches us about the worth of things.","Arthur Schopenhauer"
"The cheapest form of pride... is national pride. For it betrays in the one thus afflicted the lack of individual qualities of which he could be proud, while he would not otherwise reach for what he shares with so many millions. He who possesses significant personal merits will rather recognise the defects of his own nation, as he has them constantly before his eyes, most clearly. But that poor beggar who has nothing in the world of which he can be proud, latches onto the last means of being proud, the nation to which he belongs to. Thus he recovers and is now in gratitude ready to defend with hands and feet all errors and follies which are its own.","Arthur Schopenhauer"
"Money is human happiness in the abstract: he, then, who is no longer capable of enjoying human happiness in the concrete devotes his heart entirely to money.","Arthur Schopenhauer"
"To free a man from error is to give, not to take away. Knowledge that a thing is false is a truth. Error always does harm; sooner or later it will bring mischief to the man who harbors it. Then give up deceiving people; confess ignorance of what you don't know, and leave everyone to form his own articles of faith for himself. Perhaps they won't turn out so bad, especially as they'll rub one another's corners down, and mutually rectify mistakes. The existence of many views will at any rate lay a foundation of tolerance. Those who possess knowledge and capacity may betake themselves to the study of philosophy, or even in their own persons carry the history of philosophy a step further.","Arthur Schopenhauer"
"One must choose one's enemies carefully, as one ends up resembling them.","Jorge Luis Borges"
"One is in love when one realizes that the other person is unique.","Jorge Luis Borges"
"If one looks with a cold eye at the mess man has made of history, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that he has been afflicted by some built-in mental disorder which drives him towards self-destruction.","Arthur Koestler"
"Even a cursory glance at history should convince one that individual crimes committed for selfish motives play a quite insignificant part in the human tragedy, compared to the numbers massacred in unselfish loyalty to oneâ€™s tribe, nation, dynasty, church, or political ideology, ad majorem gloriam dei. The emphasis is on unselfish. Excepting a small minority of mercenary or sadistic disposition, wars are not fought for personal gain, but out of loyalty and devotion to king, country or cause. Homicide committed for personal reasons is a statistical rarity in all cultures, including our own. Homicide for unselfish reasons, at the risk of oneâ€™s own life, is the dominant phenomenon of history.","Arthur Koestler"
"The inner censor of the mind of the true believer completes the work of the public censor; his self-discipline is as tyrannical as the obedience imposed by the regime; he terrorizes his own conscience into submission; he carries his private Iron Curtain inside his skull, to protect his illusions against the intrusion of reality.","Arthur Koestler"
"Modern man lives isolated in his artificial environment, not because the artificial is evil as such, but because of his lack of comprehension of the forces which make it work- of the principles which relate his gadgets to the forces of nature, to the universal order. It is not central heating which makes his existence â€˜unnatural,â€™ but his refusal to take an interest in the principles behind it. By being entirely dependent on science, yet closing his mind to it, he leads the life of an urban barbarian.","Arthur Koestler"
"The prerequisite of originality is the art of forgetting, at the proper moment, what we know.","Arthur Koestler"
"The more one suffers, the more, I believe, one has a sense of the comic. It is only by the deepest suffering that one acquires the authority in the art of the comic.","Soren Kierkegaard"
"To be a teacher does not mean simply to affirm that such a thing is so, or to deliver a lecture, etc. No, to be a teacher in the right sense is to be a learner. Instruction begins when you, the teacher, learn from the learner, put yourself in his place so that you may understand what he understands and the way he understands it.","Soren Kierkegaard"
"The presence of irony does not necessarily mean that the earnestness is excluded. Only assistant professors assume that.","Soren Kierkegaard"
"Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.","Soren Kierkegaard"
"The tyrant dies and his rule is over; the martyr dies and his rule begins.","Soren Kierkegaard"
"Language is not an abstract construction of the learned, or of dictionary makers, but is something arising out of the work, needs, ties, joys, affections, tastes, of long generations of humanity, and has its bases broad and low, close to the ground.","Noah Webster"
"Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones.","Marcus Aurelius"
"Any advertisement in public space that gives you no choice whether you see it or not is yours. It belongs to you. It's yours to take, re-arrange, and re-use. Asking for permission is like asking to keep a rock someone just threw at your head.","Banksy"
"It is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself. Infidelity does not consist in believing, or in disbelieving; it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe.","Thomas Paine"
"Is man one of God's blunders or is God one of man's?","Friedrich Nietzsche"
"American life is a powerful solvent. It seems to neutralize every intellectual element, however tough and alien it may be, and to fuse it in the native good will, complacency, thoughtlessness, and optimism.","George Santayana"
"They [the wise spirits of antiquity in the first circle of Dante's Inferno] are condemned, Dante tells us, to no other penalty than to live in desire without hope, a fate appropriate to noble souls with a clear vision of life.","George Santayana"

"Perhaps the only true dignity of man is his capacity to despise himself.","George Santayana"
"The world is a perpetual caricature of itself; at every moment it is the mockery and the contradiction of what it is pretending to be.","George Santayana"
"There is no cure for birth and death save to enjoy the interval.","George Santayana, philosopher"
"I like to walk about amidst the beautiful things that adorn the world; but private wealth I should decline, or any sort of personal possessions, because they would take away my liberty.","George Santayana"
"Only the dead have seen the end of war.","George Santayana"
"The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.","Carl Sagan"

"Religions, which condemn the pleasures of sense, drive men to seek the pleasures of power. Throughout history power has been the vice of the ascetic.","Bertrand Russell"
"Many orthodox people speak as though it were the business of sceptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatists to prove them. This is, of course, a mistake. If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time.","Bertrand Russell"
"Wherever one finds oneself inclined to bitterness, it is a sign of emotional failure: a larger heart, and a greater self-restraint, would put a calm autumnal sadness in the place of the instinctive outcry of pain.","Bertrand Russell"
"I cannot believe - and I say this with all the emphasis of which I am capable - that there can ever be any good excuse for refusing to face the evidence in favour of something unwelcome. It is not by delusion, however exalted, that mankind can prosper, but only by unswerving courage in the pursuit of truth.","Bertrand Russell"
"A process which led from the amÅ“ba to man appeared to the philosophers to be obviously a progress - though whether the amÅ“ba would agree with this opinion is not known.","Bertrand Russell"
"Those who forget good and evil and seek only to know the facts are more likely to achieve good than those who view the world through the distorting medium of their own desires.","Bertrand Russell"
"An extra-terrestrial philosopher, who had watched a single youth up to the age of twenty-one and had never come across any other human being, might conclude that it is the nature of human beings to grow continually taller and wiser in an indefinite progress towards perfection; and this generalisation would be just as well founded as the generalisation which evolutionists base upon the previous history of this planet.","Bertrand Russell"
"In adolescence, I hated life and was continually on the verge of suicide... Now, on the contrary, I enjoy life; I might almost say that with every year that passes I enjoy it more... very largely it is due to a diminishing preoccupation with myself. Like others who had a Puritan education, I had the habit of meditating on my sins, follies, and shortcomings. I seemed to myself - no doubt justly - a miserable specimen. Gradually I learned to be indifferent to myself and my deficiencies; I came to centre my attention increasingly upon external objects: the state of the world, various branches of knowledge, individuals for whom I felt affection.","Bertrand Russell"
"Conventional people are roused to fury by departures from convention, largely because they regard such departures as a criticism of themselves.","Bertrand Russell"
"The fundamental concept in social science is Power, in the same sense in which Energy is the fundamental concept in physics.","Bertrand Russell"
"To acquire immunity to eloquence is of the utmost importance to the citizens of a democracy.","Bertrand Russell"
"After ages during which the earth produced harmless trilobites and butterflies, evolution progressed to the point at which it generated Neros, Genghis Khans, and Hitlers. This, however, is a passing nightmare; in time the earth will become again incapable of supporting life, and peace will return.","Bertrand Russell"
"The Christian ideal has not been tried and found wanting. It has been found difficult and left untried.","G.K. Chesterton"
"In the Beginning, the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move.","Douglas Adams"
"If I were granted omnipotence, and millions of years to experiment in, I should not think Man much to boast of as the final result of all my efforts.","Bertrand Russell"
"Standard English is a convenient abstraction, like the average man.","Geroge Leslie Brook"

"Nobody realizes that some people expend tremendous energy merely to be normal.","Albert Camus"
"There is always a philosophy for lack of courage.","Albert Camus"
"The greatest saving one can make in the order of thought is to accept the unintelligibility of the world - and to pay attention to man.","Albert Camus"
"Homo sapiens is the species that invents symbols in which to invest passion and authority, then forgets that symbols are inventions.","Joyce Carol Oates"

"If people are good only because they fear punishment, and hope for reward, then we are a sorry lot indeed.","Albert Einstein"
"True teachers are those who use themselves as bridges over which they invite their students to cross; then, having facilitated their crossing, joyfully collapse, encouraging them to create their own.","Nikos Kazantzakis"
"He that uses many words for explaining any subject, doth, like the cuttlefish, hide himself for the most part in his own ink.","John Ray"
"The human mind is inspired enough when it comes to inventing horrors; it is when it tries to invent a heaven that it shows itself cloddish.","Evelyn Waugh"
"Don't give your opinions about Art and the Purpose of Life. They are of little interest and, anyway, you can't express them. Don't analyze yourself. Give the relevant facts and let your readers make their own judgments. Stick to your story. It is not the most important subject in history but it is one about which you are uniquely qualified to speak.","Evelyn Waugh"
"I don't believe that people would ever fall in love or want to be married if they hadn't been told about it. It's like abroad: no one would want to go there if they hadn't been told it existed.","Evelyn Waugh"
"I react pragmatically. Where the market works, I'm for that. Where the government is necessary, I'm for that. I'm deeply suspicious of somebody who says, 'I'm in favor of privatization,' or, 'I'm deeply in favor of public ownership.' I'm in favor of whatever works in the particular case.","John Kenneth Galbraith"
"I believe in evidence. I believe in observation, measurement, and reasoning, confirmed by independent observers. I'll believe anything, no matter how wild and ridiculous, if there is evidence for it. The wilder and more ridiculous something is, however, the firmer and more solid the evidence will have to be.","Isaac Asimov"
"A gun gives you the body, not the bird.","Henry David Thoreau"
"Cautious, careful people, always casting about to preserve their reputation and social standing, never can bring about a reform. Those who are really in earnest must be willing to be anything or nothing in the world's estimation.","Susan B. Anthony"

"One need not hope in order to undertake, nor succeed in order to persevere.","William the Silent"
"Don't let them tell us stories. Don't let them say of the man sentenced to death 'He is going to pay his debt to society,' but: 'They are going to cut off his head.' It looks like nothing. But it does make a little difference.","Albert Camus"
"There is no fate that can not be surmounted by scorn.","Albert Camus"
"'I conclude that all is well,' says Oedipus, and that remark is sacred. It echoes in the wild and limited universe of man. It teaches that all is not, has not been, exhausted. It drives out of this world a god who had come into it with dissatisfaction and a preference for futile suffering. It makes of fate a human matter, which must be settled among men. ...Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods and raises rocks. He too concludes that all is well. This universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night-filled mountain, in itself forms a world. The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.","Albert Camus"
"Query: How to contrive not to waste one's time? Answer: By being fully aware of it all the while. Ways in which this can be done: By spending one's days on an uneasy chair in a dentist's waiting room; by remaining on one's balcony all a Sunday afternoon; by travelling by the longest and least-convenient train routes, and of course standing all the way; by queueing at the box-office of theatres and then not booking a seat.","Albert Camus"
"Having money is a way of being free of money.","Albert Camus"
"He marveled at the strange blindness by which men, though they are so alert to what changes in themselves, impose on their friends an image chosen for them once and for all.","Albert Camus"
"I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours.","Stephen Roberts"
"Inspiration is not the exclusive privilege of poets or artists. There is, there has been, there will always be a certain group of people whom inspiration visits. It's made up of all those who've consciously chosen their calling and do their job with love and imagination. It may include doctors, teachers, gardeners - I could list a hundred more professions. Their work becomes one continuous adventure as long as they manage to keep discovering new challenges in it. Difficulties and setbacks never quell their curiosity. A swarm of new questions emerges from every problem that they solve. Whatever inspiration is, it's born from a continuous 'I don't know.","Wislawa Szymborska"
"The world - whatever we might think when terrified by its vastness and our own impotence, or embittered by its indifference to individual suffering, of people, animals, and perhaps even plants, for why are we so sure that plants feel no pain; whatever we might think of its expanses pierced by the rays of stars surrounded by planets we've just begun to discover, planets already dead? still dead? we just don't know; whatever we might think of this measureless theater to which we've got reserved tickets, but tickets whose lifespan is laughably short, bounded as it is by two arbitrary dates; whatever else we might think of this world - it is astonishing.","Wislawa Szymborska"
"Not long ago, if you wanted to seize political power in a country you had merely to control the army and the police. Today it is only in the most backward countries that fascist generals, in carrying out a coup d'Ã©tat, still use tanks. If a country has reached a high degree of industrialization the whole scene changes. The day after the fall of Khrushchev, the editors of Pravda, Izvestiia, the heads of the radio and television were replaced; the army wasn't called out. Today a country belongs to the person who controls communications.","Umberto Eco"
"Semiotics is in principle the discipline studying everything which can be used in order to lie. If something cannot be used to tell a lie, conversely it cannot be used to tell the truth: it cannot in fact be used 'to tell' at all.","Umberto Eco"
"The real hero is always a hero by mistake; he dreams of being an honest coward like everybody else. If it had been possible he would have settled the matter otherwise, and without bloodshed. He doesn't boast of his own death or of others'. But he does not repent. He suffers and keeps his mouth shut; if anything, others then exploit him, making him a myth, while he, the man worthy of esteem, was only a poor creature who reacted with dignity and courage in an event bigger than he was.","Umberto Eco"
"Language is the armoury of the human mind; and at once contains the trophies of its past, and the weapons of its future conquests.","Samuel Taylor Coleridge"

"I need someone to protect me from all the measures they take in order to protect me.","Banksy"
"A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly.

"Pride, like laudanum and other poisonous medicines, is beneficial in small, though injurious in large, quantities. No man who is not pleased with himself, even in a personal sense, can please others.","Frederick Saunders"
"The living language is like a cow-path: it is the creation of the cows themselves, who, having created it, follow it or depart from it according to their whims or their needs. From daily use, the path undergoes change. A cow is under no obligation to stay.","E.B. White"

"Moderate strength is shown in violence, supreme strength is shown in levity.","G.K. Chesterton"
"I believe what really happens in history is this: the old man is always wrong; and the young people are always wrong about what is wrong with him. The practical form it takes is this: that, while the old man may stand by some stupid custom, the young man always attacks it with some theory that turns out to be equally stupid.","G.K. Chesterton"

"Creative activity could be described as a type of learning process where teacher and pupil are located in the same individual.","Arthur Koestler"
"Because we don't understand the brain very well we're constantly tempted to use the latest technology as a model for trying to understand it. In my childhood we were always assured that the brain was a telephone switchboard. (What else could it be?) And I was amused to see that Sherrington, the great British neuroscientist, thought that the brain worked like a telegraph system. Freud often compared the brain to hydraulic and electromagnetic systems. Leibniz compared it to a mill, and now, obviously, the metaphor is the digital computer.","John R. Searle"
"We judge ourselves by what we feel capable of doing, while others judge us by what we have already done.","Henry Wadsworth Longfellow"
"Once I ventured the guess that men worked in response to a vague inner urge for self-expression... An hypothesis with rather more plausibility in it now suggests itself. It is that men work simply in order to escape the depressing agony of contemplating life â€“ that their work, like their play, is a mumbo-jumbo that serves them by permitting them to escape from reality... Man cannot sit still, contemplating his destiny in this world, without going frantic. So he invents ways to take his mind off the horror. He works. He plays. He accumulates the preposterous nothing called property. He strives for the coy eye-wink called fame. He founds a family and spreads his curse over others. All the while the thing that moves him is simply the yearning to lose himself, to forget himself, to escape the tragic-comedy that is himself. Life, fundamentally, is not worth living.","H.L. Mencken"
"Wanting to meet an author because you like his work is like wanting to meet a duck because you like patÃ©.","Margaret Atwood"

"Satire is a sort of glass, wherein beholders do generally discover everybody's face but their own, which is the chief reason for that kind of reception it meets in the world, and that so very few are offended with it.","Jonathan Swift"
"Moderate giftedness has been made worthless by the printing press and radio and television and satellites and all that. A moderately gifted person who would have been a community treasure a thousand years ago has to give up, has to go into some other line of work, since modern communications put him or her into daily competition with nothing but world's champions.","Kurt Vonnegut"
"Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies.","Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche"

"We are not afraid to entrust the American people with unpleasant facts, foreign ideas, alien philosophies, and competitive values. For a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.","John F. Kennedy"
"A physician is not angry at the intemperance of a mad patient; nor does he take it ill to be railed at by a man in a fever. Just so should a wise man treat all mankind, as a physician does his patient; and looking upon them only as sick and extravagant.","Lucius Annaeus Seneca"
"An individual human existence should be like a river: small at first, narrowly contained within its banks, and rushing passionately past rocks and over waterfalls. Gradually the river grows wider, the banks recede, the waters flow more quietly, and in the end, without any visible break, they become merged in the sea, and painlessly lose their individual being.","Bertrand Russell"

"In all affairs it's a healthy thing now and then to hang a question mark on the things you have long taken for granted.","Bertrand Russell"

"There are stars whose radiance is visible on Earth though they have long been extinct. There are people whose brilliance continues to light the world though they are no longer among the living. These lights are particularly bright when the night is dark. They light the way for humankind.","Hannah Senesh"
"I'd like to widen people's awareness of the tremendous timespan lying ahead - for our planet, and for life itself. Most educated people are aware that we're the outcome of nearly 4bn years of Darwinian selection, but many tend to think that humans are somehow the culmination. Our sun, however, is less than halfway through its lifespan. Six billion years from now, it will not be humans who watch the sun's demise. Any creatures that then exist will be as different from us as we are from bacteria or amoebae.","Martin Rees"

"No man should judge unless he asks himself in absolute honesty whether in a similar situation he might not have done the same.","Viktor Frankl"
"Totalitarianism, however, does not so much promise an age of faith as an age of schizophrenia. A society becomes totalitarian when its structure becomes flagrantly artificial: that is, when its ruling class has lost its function but succeeds in clinging to power by force or fraud. Such a society, no matter how long it persists, can never afford to become either tolerant or intellectually stable. It can never permit either the truthful recording of facts or the emotional sincerity that literary creation demands.","George Orwell"

"...success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself.

"To blame the poor for subsisting on welfare has no justice unless we are also willing to judge every rich member of society by how productive he or she is.

"The late F.W.H. Myers used to tell how he asked a man at a dinner table what he thought would happen to him when he died. The man tried to ignore the question, but on being pressed, replied: 'Oh well, I suppose I shall inherit eternal bliss, but I wish you wouldn't talk about such unpleasant subjects.","Bertrand Russell"
"The moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are in the shadows of life - the sick, the needy and the handicapped.","Hubert Horatio Humphrey"

"It was amazing that in this country where people allowed emotion to guide their politics they approached love with the precision of accountants.","Naguib Mahfouz"

"Failure is the condiment that gives success its flavor.","Truman Capote"
"People who are having a love-sex relationship are continuously lying to each other... you have to make a love object of this person, which means that you editorialize about them... You cut out what you don't want to see, you add this if it isn't there... But in a friendship you... do exactly the reverse. You try more and more to be as completely pure and straight as you can be.","Truman Capote"

"The most important component of evolution is death... it's easier to create a new organism than to change an existing one.","John Ousterhourt"
"Facts precede concepts: a fact is a piece of information that can be observed or measured; a concept is a general rule that can be used to predict many facts or a solution to many problems... before you can appreciate or develop a concept you need to observe a large number of facts related to the concept.","John Ousterhourt"
"Always too eager for the future, we / Pick up bad habits of expectancy.","Philip Larkin"

"History is the autobiography of a madman.","Alexander Herzen"
"History... is the ultimate in speculative narrative, subject to ongoing and inevitable revision. Science fiction tends to behave like a species of history pointing in the opposite direction, up the timeline rather than back. But you can't draw imaginary future histories without a map of the past that your readers will accept as their own.","William Gibson"

"We're all going to die, all of us, what a circus! That alone should make us love each other but it doesn't. We are terrorized and flattened by trivialities, we are eaten up by nothing.","Charles Bukowski"
"It is probably true that business corrupts everything it touches. It corrupts politics, sports, literature, art, labor unions and so on. But business also corrupts and undermines monolithic totalitarianism. Capitalism is at its liberating best in a noncapitalist environment.","Eric Hoffer"
"Faith in a holy cause is to a considerable extent a substitute for the lost faith in ourselves.","Eric Hoffer"
"It has often been said that power corrupts. But it is perhaps equally important to realize that weakness, too, corrupts. Power corrupts the few, while weakness corrupts the many.","Eric Hoffer"
"Rudeness is the weak man's imitation of strength.","Eric Hoffer"
"It is easier to love humanity as a whole than to love one's neighbor.","Eric Hoffer"
"You accept certain unlovely things about yourself and manage to live with them. The atonement for such an acceptance is that you make allowances for others - that you cleanse yourself of the sin of self-righteousness.","Eric Hoffer"
"The significant point is that people... who cannot do much with (freedom) are hungry for power. The desire for freedom... says: leave me alone and I shall grow, learn, and realize my capacities. Freedom gives us a chance to realize our human and individual uniqueness. Absolute power can also bestow uniqueness: to have absolute power is to have the power to reduce all the people around us to puppets, robots, toys, or animals, and be the only man in sight. Absolute power achieves uniqueness by dehumanizing others. To sum up: Those who lack the capacity to achieve much in an atmosphere of freedom will clamor for power.","Eric Hoffer"
"It is the individual only who is timeless. Societies, cultures, and civilizations - past and present - are often incomprehensible to outsiders, but the individual's hunger, anxieties, dreams, and preoccupations have remained unchanged through the millennia. Thus, we are up against the paradox that the individual who is more complex, unpredictable, and mysterious than any communal entity is the one nearest to our understanding; so near that even the interval of millennia cannot weaken our feeling of kinship.","Eric Hoffer"
"It is not good for our efforts at self-realization to know the opinions other people have of us. It is difficult or perhaps impossible to be ourselves if we are known.","Eric Hoffer"
"Nature gets credit which should in truth be reserved for ourselves: the rose for its scent, the nightingale for its song, and the sun for its radiance. The poets are entirely mistaken. They should address their lyrics to themselves and should turn them into odes of self-congratulation on the excellence of the human mind.","Alfred North Whitehead"
"It is a profoundly erroneous truism... that we should cultivate the habit of thinking of what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.","Alfred North Whitehead"
"Work destroys your soul by stealthily invading your brain during the hours not officially spent working; be selective about professions.","Nassim Nicholas Taleb"

"Business wars are typically lost by both parties; academic wars are won by both sides.","Nassim Nicholas Taleb"
"People focus on role models; it is more effective to find antimodels - people you donâ€™t want to resemble when you grow up.","Nassim Nicholas Taleb"
"The twentieth century was the bankruptcy of the social utopia; the twenty-first will be that of the technological one.","Nassim Nicholas Taleb"
"For so many, instead of looking for 'cause of death' when they expire, we should be looking for 'cause of life' when they are still around.","Nassim Nicholas Taleb"

"A heuristic on whether you have control of your life: can you take naps?","Nassim Nicholas Taleb"

"To become a philosopher, start by walking very slowly.","Nassim Nicholas Taleb"
"It is perplexing but amusing to observe people getting extremely excited about things you donâ€™t care about; it is sinister to watch them ignore things you believe are fundamental.","Nassim Nicholas Taleb"
"Let us find what risks we can measure and these are the risks we should be taking.","Nassim Nicholas Taleb"
"Contra the prevailing belief, 'success' isnâ€™t being on top of a hierarchy, it is standing outside all hierarchies.","Nassim Nicholas Taleb"
"A happier world is one in which everyone realizes that 1) it is not what you tell people, it is how you say it that makes them feel bad; 2) it is not what you do to them but how you make them look that gets them angry; 3) they should be the ones putting themselves in a specific category.","Nassim Nicholas Taleb"
"Scientific research is not conducted in a social vacuum.","Robert King Merton"
"Men do not sufficiently realise that their future is in their own hands. Theirs is the task of determining first of all whether they want to go on living or not. Theirs is the responsibility, then, for deciding if they want merely to live, or intend to make just the extra effort required for fulfilling, even on their refractory planet, the essential function of the universe, which is a machine for the making of gods.","Henri-Louis Bergson"
"I am far from denying the destructive and disintegrating forces of passion. I will go so far as to agree that apart from the reproductive function, men have hitherto used love, on the whole, as an instrument of self-corruption and intoxication. But what do these excesses prove? Because fire consumes and electricity can kill are we to stop using them? ...In every domain of the real (physical, affective, intellectual) 'danger' is a sign of power. Only a mountain can create a terrifying drop. ...'The more dangerous a thing, the more is its conquest ordained by life': it is from that conviction that the modern world has emerged; and from that our religion, too, must be reborn.","Pierre Teilhard de Chardin"
"What paralyzes life is lack of faith and lack of audacity. The difficulty lies not in solving problems but expressing them.","Pierre Teilhard de Chardin"
"It is biologically evident that to gain control of passion and so make it serve spirit must be a condition of progress. Sooner or later, then, the world will brush aside our incredulity and take this step... after harnessing the ether, the winds, the tides, gravitation, we shall harness for God the energies of love. And, on that day, for the second time in the history of the world, man will have discovered fire.","Pierre Teilhard de Chardin"
"That (statement) which is simple is always false. That which isn't is unusable.","Paul Valery"
"All criticism is dominated by the outworn theory that the man is the cause of the work as in the eyes of the law the criminal is the cause of the crime. Far rather are they both the effects.","Paul Valery"
"God made everything out of nothing. But the nothingness shows through.","Paul Valery"
"Many animals of our scale greatly exceed our range of perception for sensations familiar to us. ...What an imperceptive lot we are... we mistake the tricks of mediocre magicians for glimpses of a psychic world beyond our ken. The paranormal may be a fantasy; it is certainly a haven for charlatans. But 'parahuman' powers of perception lie all about us in birds, bees, and bacteria.","Stephen Jay Gould"
"The human mind delights in finding patternâ€”so much so that we often mistake coincidence or forced analogy for profound meaning. No other habit of thought lies so deeply within the soul of a small creature trying to make sense of a complex world not constructed for it.","Stephen Jay Gould"
"[S]cientists are not robotic inducing machines that infer structures of explanation only from regularities observed in natural phenomena... [they] are human beings, immersed in culture, and struggling with all the curious tools of inference that mind permits... Culture can potentiate as well as constrainâ€”as Darwin's translation of Adam Smith's laissez-faire economic models into biology as the theory of natural selection.","Stephen Jay Gould"
"I despair of persuading people to drop the... tactic of dichotomy. Perhaps, instead, we might [seek] other dichotomies... different from the conventional divisions. All dichotomies are simplifications, but the rendition of a conflict along differing axes... might provide an amplitude of proper intellectual space without forcing us to forgo our most comforting tool of thought.","Stephen Jay Gould"
"Before Kuhn, most scientists followed the place-a-stone-in-the-bright-temple-of-knowledge tradition... Now most scientists of vision hope to foment revolution. We are, therefore, awash in revolutions, most self-proclaimed.","Stephen Jay Gould"
"I am, somehow, less interested in the weight and convolutions of Einsteinâ€™s brain than in the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and died in cotton fields and sweatshops.","Stephen Jay Gould"
"The facts of nature are what they are, but we can only view them through the spectacles of our mind. Our mind works largely by metaphor and comparison, not always (or often) by relentless logic. When we are caught in conceptual traps, the best exit is often a change in metaphor.","Stephen Jay Gould"
"There are no shortcuts to moral insight. Nature is not intrinsically anything that can offer comfort or solace in human termsâ€”if only because our species is such an insignificant latecomer in a world not constructed for us. So much the better. The answers to moral dilemmas are not lying out there, waiting to be discovered. They reside, like the kingdom of God, within usâ€”the most difficult and inaccessible spot for any discovery or consensus.","Stephen Jay Gould"
"Bacteria represent the world's greatest success story. They are today and have always been the modal organisms on earth; they cannot be nuked to oblivion and will outlive us all. This time is their time, not the 'age of mammals' as our textbooks chauvinistically proclaim. But their price for such success is permanent relegation to a microworld, and they cannot know the joy and pain of consciousness. We live in a universe of trade-offs; complexity and persistence do not work well as partners.","Stephen Jay Gould"
"War is what happens when language fails.","Margaret Atwood"
"One of the signs of a dying civilization is that its language breaks down into exclusive dialects which prevent communication. A growing, healthy civilization uses language as a daily tool to keep the machinery of society moving.","John Ralston Saul"
"[Socrates'] exit is wonderfully seductive. It is calm, clear, convincing. Friends are present, wise words are said, the ethical unfolding of life is tied up in a neat package. And then he slips away, slowly becoming stone-cold from the feet up. It is our fantasy of the normal death... most of us will likely drop dead on a subway platform, in the middle of an orgasm or straining on a toilet seat early in the morning. The real tragedy of death may be just how often it is comic.","John Ralston Saul"
"Art instills the fundamental moral lesson: That you aren't the center of the universe. That others weren't created for your benefit. That they are just as real as you, with equal claimes to dignity and understanding. ","William Deresiewicz"
"College, after all, as those who like to denigrate it often say, is 'not the real world.' But that is precisely its strength. College is an opportunity to stand outside the world for a few years, between the orthodoxy of your family and the exigencies of career, and contemplate things from a distance.","William Deresiewicz"
"The camera has created a culture of celebrity; the computer is creating a culture of connectivity. As the two technologies converge -- broadband tipping the Web from text to image, social-networking sites spreading the mesh of interconnection ever wider -- the two cultures betray a common impulse. Celebrity and connectivity are both ways of becoming known. This is what the contemporary self wants. It wants to be recognized, wants to be connected: It wants to be visible. ...This is the quality that validates us, this is how we become real to ourselves -- by being seen by others... if the property that grounded the self, in Romanticism, was sincerity, and in modernism it was authenticity, then in postmodernism it is visibility.","William Deresiewicz"
"I invented nothing new. I simply assembled the discoveries of other men behind whom were centuries of work. Had I worked fifty or ten or even five years before, I would have failed. So it is with every new thing. Progress happens when all the factors that make for it are ready, and then it is inevitable. To teach that a comparatively few men are responsible for the greatest forward steps of mankind is the worst sort of nonsense.","Henry Ford"
"Measurement: a quantitatively expressed reduction of uncertainty based on one or more observations.","Douglas W. Hubbard"
