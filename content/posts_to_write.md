## Project: Z≈ç
- The grammarly for SRS cardbuilding
- Declarative/content knowledge: SRS
- Explicit procedural knowledge: checklist
- Implicit procedural knowledge: practice
- As concurrent proof-of-concept: use it to Ankify grad school notes
- For coding projects: add a git commit-hook to send [the diff, and-or the commit message?] to a text-dump that the user will later be notified to reference for content to be mined/added to the SRS.

## Project: B2E
- Designed for post-DuoLingo language learners
  - Name is a silly pun: "We want to get to B2," but also "not B2B or B2C; rather, B2-everyone/B-2-we"
- Combine 'SRS lexis-extractor' with daily-generated cards
  - PocketBrain -- friendly/external name for SRS component
- Pairs of learners receive a quote daily, in alternating language
  - Monday...
    - U/US translates from EN to UA;
    - U/UA translates from EN to UA; then
    - (_discuss, or U/UA merely highlights reasons for?_) differences between the two translations.
  - Tuesday, it switches: learners receive UA quote; now, U/US explains their translation decisions
- Can this resolve the (_disparity/overpopularity of EN-learners_), via e.g. aggregator for daily translations?
  - In -to-many groups, provide translation leaderboard, visible only after submission-of-your-translation?
  - Will require translation-flagging, as well as perhaps e.g. Lobte.rs-style invite-tree

## Archive/Soft-Deletes

<!-- ## Project: O'Reilly Cookbook Reprocessing
- Explore how to turn "reading a '`* Cookbook`' O'Reilly text" into more of an interactive, problem-solving activity.
- Possibly using principle of "progressive disclosure" of hints, as requested by user (e.g. first click on card gives you desc of line of code in EN, next lists obj, next lists method, next lists argument?)
- combination of two apps:
  - `cookbook_kata`
    - emails two recipes, daily (first FE: CSS and JS, then Server: Bash and SQL)
    - If a recipe seems useful, allows you to forward it to `brick_collector`
  - `brick_collector`
    - a [https://notes.zander.wtf/, https://github.com/jbranchaud/til]-esque clippings site
    - each TIL/snippet page has a button, which onClick... 
      - increments count of times you've used the snippet
      - allows you to also add which repo/code you used the snippet in
      - automatically collects the date
    - link to 'usages', a mini-dashboard of that snippet's usages (the data saved from the clicker) -->

<!-- ## Project: evictual
- Track [for "get to 0" / for saving up, via $ or C02 offset, to splurge on a _noice_ meaty meal e.g. -/wk]
- Track [for low-carb / for low-cost / for low-C02s] -->
  
<!-- ## Project: ProductiveHN
- Consume HN API
- Desktop-only
- Tree views of top-level comments, with the ability to filter top-level comments having fewer responses
- Ability to click a given comment to have its responses also splinter into different nodes
- Ability to click a keyword to search hn.algolia.com for similar posts -->

<!-- ## Project: Eno 
- GUI for content professors (_i.e. experts in research, but not pedagogy_) to build lessons, guided by sound teaching principles and pleasing design.
- Sold to universities: align with institution-unique accreditation requirements.
  - Software that takes an instructor from subject matter expert tune near-professional educator, by scaffolding their building of lesson plans, assessments, and syllabi.
  - ‚ÄúValuable subjects change so quickly in this field (tech); this software works with an expert in that field to create a replicable, distributable, project/portfolio-based curriculum, so you can offer courses that will get your graduates jobs.‚Äù
- How to make lesson planning easier, faster, more certain?
- Help teachers defend decisions with research (i.e. engage with and protect against parents & admin)
- UI for [content and activity] selection (for touchscreen access)
- Track [content and activity]-types across lessons (by week, unit, semester etc)
- (_Note you have two reaaaaaal ugly back-of-the-napkin wireframe illustrations for this in Dropbox._) -->

- comparing and searching for different rubrics by which to measure an e-learning product:
- concluding with that you can‚Äôt actually write about the product, because they are clients of the company that employs you
- Rate the learning experience of the badge course you‚Äôre currently taking
  - Suitably anonymize it, first, per blogpost above
  - Better done when you can compare two programs (perhaps the Linux/Docker course?)
