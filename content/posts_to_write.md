# Stuff You Could Do Right Now

## Read a thing; build a thing

### Currently: RoR App (see `opl_plans.md`)

### Next: React Hooks/Context Toy App

1. D&D Character Generator

- Use as tool for learning hooks, context, and suspense.
  - Reference [this article](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-state) for creating global state with hooks and context, instead of redux.
  - Reference [this article](https://wattenberger.com/blog/react-hooks) for more on using hooks naturally
  - Follow the FEM Pure React State Management workshop/notes, as well
- Think through 'React Architecture'
  - Use suggestions from [this document.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tsid5bnphznbvjv/Lessons%20learned%20from%205%20years%20in%20React.docx)
  - Extract learnings from [Cooperpress' most-popular 2019 React articles](https://react.statuscode.com/issues/169), too
- Include TypeScript? Or is that too much?

1. Ruby chapter in _Json At Work_ (O'Reilly) to provide data: keep it simple && straightforward

### Next: (Maybe?) RN App

1. Watch React Native series [from GoRails](https://gorails.com/episodes/tagged/React%20Native)

1. Read [this book](https://github.com/madeindjs/api_on_rails) on RoR API mode

1. Read _Learning React Native_ (O'Reilly)

1. Create RoR JSON API / React Native app to

- perform the equivalent of an Anki deck of cognitive biases/logical fallacies (just scrape Wikipedia for content); or
- serve as a [decision journal](https://fs.blog/2014/02/decision-journal/)

### Next: O'Reilly Cookbook Reprocessing

1. _Explore how to turn (the process of reading a_ '`* Cookbook`' _O'Reilly text, after having engaged in a basic primer in the technology) into more of an interactive, problem-solving activity_

   - Possibly, for each, build a https://lab.github.com/ course?
   - Possibly using principle of "progressive disclosure" of hints, as requested by user (e.g. first click on card gives you desc of line of code in EN, next lists obj, next lists method, next lists argument?)

1. Bash Cookbook (O'Reilly)

1. SQL Cookbook (O'Reilly)

1. Javascript Cookbook (O'Reilly)

1. CSS Cookbook (O'Reilly)

1. Regex Cookbook (O'Reilly)

1. `${Add projects from "Next Steps" section of 'Revisiting' and 'Ideas' files}`

### Next: hashtag #gitgud at [Ruby, or anything else you've got O'Reilly books for]

   - The [Open Ed Consortium](https://www.oeconsortium.org/about-oec/&sa=D&ust=1543096216915000) (global nonprofit) and [MERLOT](http://info.merlot.org/merlothelp/topic.htm%23t%3DWho_We_Are.htm&sa=D&ust=1543096216915000) (originally CSU, but now partnered with OEC?) also provide search tools (do they host/support any objects of their own, though?)
   - [Open Washington](http://www.openwa.org/&sa=D&ust=1543096216916000) has an short, introductory course on OER use and licenses.
   - [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/about/program-areas/education-oer/education-oer-resources/&sa=D&ust=1543096216917000) has a list of search tools.
1. E-Learning Rubrics
   - comparing and searching for different rubrics by which to measure an e-learning product:
   - concluding with that you can’t actually write about the product, because they are clients of the company that employs you
   - Rate the learning experience of the badge course you’re currently taking
     - Suitably anonymize it, first, per blogpost above
     - Better done when you can compare two programs (perhaps the Linux/Docker course?)
     - Which taxonomy to use?
       - “E-learning in the science of instruction”?
       - “Really Useful E-Learning Manual“ from O'Reilly (perhaps there’s an EPub version?)

## Ideas

1. **Idea:** GUI for content professors (_i.e. experts in research, but not pedagogy_) to build lessons, guided by sound teaching principles and pleasing design.

   - (_Note you have two reaaaaaal ugly back-of-the-napkin wireframe illustrations for this in Dropbox._)
   - Sold to universities: align with institution-unique accreditation requirements.
     - Software that takes an instructor from subject matter expert tune near-professional educator, by scaffolding their building of lesson plans, assessments, and syllabi.
     - “Valuable subjects change so quickly in this field (tech); this software works with an expert in that field to create a replicable, distributable, project/portfolio-based curriculum,  so you can offer courses that will get your graduates jobs.”
   - How to make lesson planning easier, faster, more certain?
   - Help teachers defend decisions with research (i.e. engage with and protect against parents & admin)
   - UI for [content and activity] selection (for touchscreen access)
   - Track [content and activity]-types across lessons (by week, unit, semester etc)

1. **Idea:** SMS-based daily speaking prompts (_for APAC white-collar EFL learners_).

   - Delivered by voice recording + optional supplementary text,
   - using push notifications/email.
   - Prompt contains topic;
   - user records impromptu speech;
   - human listener (cheap \$ in EastEur) uses SR-form to
     - write/send targeted feedback, and
     - select links for user to engage in controlled practice.
   - Variations:
     - every other day is VoIP role-play;
     - two chances to record: once w/o prep, at beginning of day, and once after receiving 5-10 potentially-useful vocabulary words.

1. **Idea:** Use noun project API to create "conversation starters" for video sessions (_e.g. speakers tell a story based on randomly-generated pics._) Options:

   - timed/untimed
   - number of images (either choose one from three, or must integrate entire set into story?)
   - Image categories
   - Bring in various Faker-generated sentences as prompts (use e.g. quotes Classes, rather than single-word entries) https://github.com/stympy/faker
   - [plenty](https://thenounproject.com/browse/) [such](https://gallery.manypixels.co/) [sources](https://www.ikonate.com/) for grabbing image-prompts, too

1. **Idea:** "Corona"

   - tool for retros && retro commentary/weigh-in (plus one's, comments, concerns, qualifications, etc)
   - web form, with support from slackbot
   - like, "Corona" refers to part of the eye -- but it also sounds like "Coroner," who performs... post-mortems. Heh.

1. **Idea:** "ThousandWord"

   - Repository for collected PF01 images
   - Use as practice w/ ElasticSearch
   - On top of a PG database?

1. **Idea:** "Cardbuilder"

   - The grammarly for SRS cardbuilding
   - Declarative/content knowledge: SRS
   - Explicit procedural knowledge: checklist
   - Implicit procedural knowledge: practice

1. Expanding what we know [vs] applying what we know -- [how to do one of those better] is what to research, perhaps? (instead of SRS for non-declarative/content knowledges)
