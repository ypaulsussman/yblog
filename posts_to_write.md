## Reread, and write a response

1. **Idea:** SMS-based Adult Literacy curriculum `**<===Current===**`

   - Use emoji as multimedia component, to prompt/associate/describe basic words.
   - [plenty](https://thenounproject.com/browse/) [such](https://gallery.manypixels.co/) [sources](https://www.ikonate.com/)

1. Meetup and Event Notes [ ]

1. **Idea:** GUI for content professors (_i.e. experts in research, but not pedagogy_) to build lessons, guided by sound teaching principles and pleasing design.

   - (_Note you have two reaaaaaal ugly back-of-the-napkin wireframe illustrations for this in Dropbox._)
   - Sold to universities: align with institution-unique accreditation requirements.
     - Software that takes an instructor from subject matter expert tune near-professional educator, by scaffolding their building of lesson plans, assessments, and syllabi.
     - “Valuable subjects change so quickly in this field (tech); this software works with an expert in that field to create a replicable, distributable, project/portfolio-based curriculum,  so you can offer courses that will get your graduates jobs.”
   - How to make lesson planning easier, faster, more certain?
   - Help teachers defend decisions with research (i.e. engage with and protect against parents & admin)
   - UI for [content and activity] selection (for touchscreen access)
   - Track [content and activity]-types across lessons (by week, unit, semester etc)

1. Business and Management Book Summaries [ ]

1. Crash Course Computer Science [ ]

1. How Language Began [ ]

1. **Idea:** SMS-based daily speaking prompts (_for APAC white-collar EFL learners_).

   - Delivered by voice recording + optional supplementary text,
   - using push notifications/email.
   - Prompt contains topic;
   - user records impromptu speech;
   - human listener (cheap \$ in EastEur) uses SR-form to
     - write/send targeted feedback, and
     - select links for user to engage in controlled practice.
   - Variations:
     - every other day is VoIP role-play;
     - two chances to record: once w/o prep, at beginning of day, and once after receiving 5-10 potentially-useful vocabulary words.

1. Crash Course Study Skills [ ]

1. Through the Language Glass [ ]

1. **Idea:** Use noun project API to create "conversation starters" for video sessions (_e.g. speakers tell a story based on randomly-generated pics._) Options:

   - timed/untimed
   - number of images (either choose one from three, or must integrate entire set into story?)
   - Image categories
   - Bring in various Faker-generated sentences as prompts (use e.g. quotes Classes, rather than single-word entries) https://github.com/stympy/faker

    - [Lumen Learning](https://lumenlearning.com/courses?&sa=D&ust=1543096216914000) (a for-profit company that uses OER to sell integrated learning analytics software)
    - The [Open Ed Consortium](https://www.oeconsortium.org/about-oec/&sa=D&ust=1543096216915000) (global nonprofit) and [MERLOT](http://info.merlot.org/merlothelp/topic.htm%23t%3DWho_We_Are.htm&sa=D&ust=1543096216915000) (originally CSU, but now partnered with OEC?) also provide search tools (do they host/support any objects of their own, though?)
    - [Open Washington](http://www.openwa.org/&sa=D&ust=1543096216916000) has an short, introductory course on OER use and licenses.
