# "yblog" - Gatsby-based blog implementation (v2)

## What _is_ this repo?

You can read about the history leading up to this repo at [its predecessor](https://github.com/ypaulsussman/learning-log/blob/master/README.md), but there's little to add on the technical side: the code for this blog is [almost entirely not my work].

The [~eighteen months of posts](https://github.com/ypaulsussman/yblog/tree/master/content/posts) are my own, and I'm ambivalently proud of them (musings, valuable; prose... an obstacle.) 

Between job changes, quarantine imbroglios, and health issues (_delicately whispers "boo, tinnitus!"_), however, I'd stopped writing posts several months before a build-breaking dependency upgrade made maintenance more of a chore than I wanted.

It was a good run, though! And it gave me enough of a taste for the "_read >> sometimes write >> sometimes build_" cycle to try it again, sometime in the future.
